**Step-by-step justification:**
1. The instruction asks to highlight the active page item in the top navigation bar. The active page appears to be the "LaBella Associates" page.
2. In the "after" image, "LaBella Associates" is not visibly highlighted or distinguished from other top navigation items (Search Jobs, Apply4Me, Resume, Career Advice).
3. The change is not visible; thus, the instruction was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
