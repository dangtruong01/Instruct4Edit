Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the footer's color scheme brighter, improving text readability against the background.
2. The after image's footer appears to have a slightly lighter background color compared to the before image. However, the difference is subtle and might not be significant enough to guarantee better readability for all users. The text color remains the same.
3. While there seems to be a slight change in the footer's background color, it's not drastic enough to definitively say the instruction was fully applied. The improvement in readability is also questionable.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
