Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the employee cards in the "Experts at LaBella Associates" section. This should result in a larger gap between the cards horizontally.
2. The after image is significantly zoomed in, making it impossible to accurately judge the spacing between the employee cards in the "Experts at LaBella Associates" section compared to the before image.
3. There are significant visual differences beyond the specified change, including overall layout and zoom. This makes it impossible to verify whether the spacing between cards was increased.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
