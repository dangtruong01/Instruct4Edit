Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to sharpen the blurred background image of the company logo in the header.
2. The company logo is located at the top left of both images. Upon close inspection, the background image behind the company logo in the "after" image appears to be negligibly sharper, if at all. It's difficult to confirm with complete certainty if a change was applied due to the image's low resolution.
3. The ambiguity arises from the subtle nature of the change and the relatively low resolution of the images provided.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
