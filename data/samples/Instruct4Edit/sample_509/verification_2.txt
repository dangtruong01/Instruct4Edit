Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle gray border at the bottom of the header.
2. Comparing the images, there is no visible difference in the header area. There's no indication of a gray border being added.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change isn't visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
