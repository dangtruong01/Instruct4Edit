**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states: "Give all navigation items in the main menu a subtle hover effect, like a light background fill, when the mouse moves over them." This means that when the user's mouse cursor is positioned over a main menu item (e.g., "网站首页", "专题专栏"), that specific item should visually change, for instance, by displaying a light background fill.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. Neither image displays any of the main navigation items in a "hovered" state (i.e., with a mouse cursor over them showing the requested background fill). The default appearance of the navigation items in the "after" image is identical to their appearance in the "before" image. The item "专题专栏" retains its red background in both images, indicating it's the active/selected page, not a hover effect.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental doubt. The instruction describes a *dynamic* visual effect (a hover state) that occurs upon user interaction. Static screenshots, by their nature, do not inherently capture dynamic interactions unless a specific element is deliberately shown *in* its interactive state (e.g., a screenshot taken *while* the mouse is hovering over an item). Since neither of the provided images shows any main menu item in a "hovered" state, it is impossible to visually verify if the instructed hover effect has been applied.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied (or more accurately, **Cannot Be Verified from Provided Images**) - Choosing "Not Applied" as per the constraints, because the visual evidence required to confirm the application of a hover effect is absent.
