**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform a list of county names, currently displayed in a two-column layout within the left sidebar, into a single-column layout where each county name occupies its own line.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** In the left sidebar section under "(县 (区) 政府信息公开)", the county names (e.g., "临孜区", "凤庆县", "云县", "永德县") are indeed arranged in two distinct columns.
    *   **After Image:** In the same section, the county names are now listed vertically, with each name clearly on its own line, forming a single column. The previous right column no longer exists; its contents have been moved below the left column's contents.

    Yes, this change is very clearly visible and precisely matches the description.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was clear about "each item appears on its own line, rather than in two columns," and the "after" image perfectly reflects this arrangement. All county names from the "before" image are present and correctly reformatted into a single-column list.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
