**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the horizontal space between the news article title and its publication date within the main content list. The purpose is to enhance the clarity and readability of each individual news entry by providing a more distinct separation between these two elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly and distinctly visible. In the "after" image, for every entry in the main news content list (the bulleted list), the space separating the end of the article title from the beginning of its date (e.g., "2023-09-13") has been significantly increased. This pushes the dates further to the right, creating a much more pronounced gap compared to the "before" image where the title and date were very closely packed. The consistent application of this increased spacing across all list items is evident.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. The spacing adjustment has been applied consistently to all relevant items in the main content list, directly fulfilling the instruction's requirement to increase spacing between the title and date. The visual outcome successfully contributes to making each entry clearer and easier to read, as intended.
