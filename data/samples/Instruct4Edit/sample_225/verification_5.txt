**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the readability of the footer text by increasing the vertical spacing between the lines of text within the footer section. This implies an increase in `line-height` or `margin-bottom` for the text elements in the footer.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, specifically focusing on the footer section at the very bottom of the page:
    *   The vertical space between the first line of text (`主办单位:临沧市人民政府...`) and the second line of text (`政务服务热线: 12345...`) appears to be unchanged. The distance between the baseline of the first line and the cap-height/x-height of the second line is identical.
    *   Similarly, the vertical space between the second line of text and the third line of text (`违法和不良信息举报...`) also appears to be exactly the same.
    *   The most prominent visual change in the footer is the replacement of the smaller, text-label-like icons/links on the third line with larger, more distinct image icons. While this is a visual change, it does not pertain to the "vertical space between each line of text" as instructed. The *text* lines themselves maintain their original spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no discernible increase in vertical spacing between the lines of text in the footer. The instruction was specifically about the *spacing between lines of text*, which has not been altered. The changes made are to the content/styling of the interactive elements on the last line, not to the line spacing of the text itself.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
