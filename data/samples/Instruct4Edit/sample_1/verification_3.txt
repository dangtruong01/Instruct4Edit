❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1.  The intended visual change is a subtle border added to the navigation bar.
2.  There is no discernible border added to the navigation bar in the "after" image.
3.  The "after" image is identical to the "before" image, thus the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
