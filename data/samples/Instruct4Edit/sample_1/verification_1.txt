Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The background color of the main content area should change to light gray. The main content area seems to be the area where the blog post and image are displayed, the space to the left of "About Me" and "Previous Posts" section.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The background color appears to be the same.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The background color is not light gray as instructed.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
