Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The right-hand sidebar should remain in a fixed position on the screen as the user scrolls down the page. The content of the sidebar should remain visible even when the main content scrolls.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, there's no indication of a fixed sidebar in either image.  Without interaction (scrolling) it's impossible to assess if the fix was implemented.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, there is no visual representation of the intended behavior. We don't know if the sidebar is fixed, or if it scrolls with the rest of the page.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
