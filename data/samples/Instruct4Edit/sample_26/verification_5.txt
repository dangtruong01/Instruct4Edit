Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to increase the width of the comment form's text fields (Name, Email, Website) and text area.
2.  **Visibility:** The text fields and text area in the "After" image do appear slightly wider than the "Before" image.
3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The change appears to be consistent and applies across all text fields as requested.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
