Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction requires the background color of the main content area to be changed to light gray. The "main content area" is the primary area displaying text and elements in the center of the layout.

2.  **Visibility of Change:**  The background of the main content area in the "after" image appears to be unchanged compared to the "before" image. Both images have a white background in the main content area.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The instruction was not implemented.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
