Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Increase the font size of the post titles. The titles in this image are "A Little Riddle" and "Vacation".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The font size appears unchanged.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The titles look identical in both images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
