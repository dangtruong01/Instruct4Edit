Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the boxes around the "Calendar" and login form. Visually, this means a slight darkening or offset around the edges of those boxes, giving them a perceived depth.
2. Comparing the before and after images, I can't see any shadow added to any of the boxes in either image. The boxes appear identical in both.
3. There's no ambiguity in the instruction itself. The term "subtle shadow" is subjective, but the absence of any shadow at all makes it clear that the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
