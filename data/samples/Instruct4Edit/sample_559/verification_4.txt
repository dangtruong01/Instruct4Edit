Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the calendar text and the edge of its containing box. However, there is no visible calendar or "containing box" containing calendar text in either image.
2. Because there is no calendar, there is no way to increase the spacing.
3. There are no calendar-related elements, making the instruction impossible to verify.

Final verdict:
