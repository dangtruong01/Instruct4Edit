Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to visually modify the input fields by adding rounded corners.
2. By comparing the two images, I see input fields in both. Upon close inspection, there is NO VISIBLE difference in the corners of the input fields. They appear to have sharp corners in both the before and after images.
3. There is no doubt. The change was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
