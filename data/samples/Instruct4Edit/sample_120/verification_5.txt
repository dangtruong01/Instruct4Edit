**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between lines of text within multi-line content paragraphs. This is commonly known as "line-height" or "leading" in typography, and its purpose is to improve readability by preventing lines of text from feeling cramped and making it easier for the eye to track from one line to the next.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible and consistently applied.
    *   In the "About Outback Construction" paragraph, the lines of text are noticeably further apart in the "after" image.
    *   The same increase in line spacing is evident in the "What Makes Us Unique?" paragraph.
    *   The paragraph under "Welcome to Outback Construction" also shows increased line spacing.
    *   The paragraph under "Contact Outback Construction" also displays wider line spacing.
    *   The address block ("ADORE $$") also has increased line spacing between its lines.
    *   The final descriptive paragraph "We would love to solve..." also shows the increased line spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the instruction specifically targets "main content paragraphs." Headings, single-line elements, and list items (like those under "Services" where each item is a single line) are not considered "main content paragraphs" in the context of increasing line spacing *within* them. The change is clearly applied to all areas that fit the description of multi-line main content paragraphs.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
