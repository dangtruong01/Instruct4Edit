Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to give the top navigation links ("Home", "About", "Contact") more prominence. The suggested methods for achieving this are increasing their font size and adding more space between them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Location:** In both images, the links "Home | About Outback Construction | Contact Us" are located at the top left of the page.
    *   **Size:** Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font size of "Home", "About Outback Construction", and "Contact Us" in the "after" image appears to be slightly larger than in the "before" image.
    *   **Spacing:** In the "before" image, the links are very close, with a minimal pipe "|" separator. In the "after" image, while the pipe separator remains, there is noticeably more horizontal space around each link and the separator, making them appear less cramped and more distinct from each other.
    *   **Visual Presence:** The combination of slightly increased size and the added spacing between the links clearly contributes to them having more visual presence compared to the cramped and smaller appearance in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the changes are clear and directly address the instruction's suggestions. The "perhaps" clause indicates that these were suggested methods, and both seem to have been implemented effectively to achieve the desired "more visual presence."
