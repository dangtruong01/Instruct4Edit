Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction requires two distinct visual changes to the primary heading about "ideas for additions to the house":
    a. Increase its font size (make it "larger").
    b. Change its horizontal alignment to be centered on the page ("centrally aligned").

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, both parts of the instruction are clearly visible:
    a. The heading "ideas for additions to the house" Services in Isle of Wight, VA, has been our specialty. is significantly larger in the "after" image compared to its size in the "before" image. The font appears bolder as well, which contributes to the perception of "larger."
    b. In the "before" image, the heading is left-aligned. In the "after" image, it has been moved to the horizontal center of the page.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, the instruction was clear and the implementation is unambiguous. Both requested changes (larger size and central alignment) have been fully and effectively applied to the identified heading.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
