Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the display of the small additional product images. The intended changes are:
    *   Remove the dark background/box surrounding each small image.
    *   Display these images on a neutral background (presumably the page's background).
    *   Increase the spacing between these small images to make them "clearly spaced out" for better viewing.
    *   Ensure they remain "below the main product picture."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the changes are very clearly visible.
    *   **"not inside a dark box" / "on a neutral background":** In the "before" image, each of the five smaller product thumbnails is enclosed within a dark, almost black, square box. In the "after" image, these dark boxes have been entirely removed. The images now sit directly on the light/white background of the webpage, which serves as the "neutral background."
    *   **"clearly spaced out below the main product picture":** In the "before" image, while separated by their dark boxes, the thumbnails appear somewhat clustered. In the "after" image, with the dark boxes gone, there is a noticeable increase in the white space *between* each thumbnail, making them appear more distinctly separated and "clearly spaced out." They remain correctly positioned below the main product image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. All aspects of the instruction appear to have been fully and accurately implemented. The visual changes perfectly match the specified requirements.

**Final verdict:**
