Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the "Accept all" button (labeled "Acceptar totes" in Catalan) in the cookie consent banner visually stronger, specifically suggesting a more vibrant background color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, in the "before" image, the "Acceptar totes" button has a muted reddish-brown background. In the "after" image, its background color has been changed to a distinct and vibrant green. This change makes the button visually stronger and more prominent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the implementation of the instruction for the specified button. The change in background color to a more vibrant green is evident and directly addresses the prompt.

**Final verdict:**
