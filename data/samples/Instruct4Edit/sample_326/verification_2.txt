Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to reposition the product name ("Barbacoes jardi Sicilia") and any accompanying description (though none is visible in either image) from its current position (below the placeholder image) to be *next to* the large product image. This change should also ensure a balanced amount of space between these elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon careful comparison, there is no discernible visual difference between the "before" and "after" images in the main product section. The product name "Barbacoes jardi Sicilia" remains positioned directly below the small image placeholder icon, and their relative positions and spacing are identical in both images. The instruction to move them "next to" each other (implying a side-by-side arrangement) has not been implemented.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no doubt; the change was not implemented. The instruction explicitly states "next to" and "balanced amount of space between them," neither of which has been addressed. The product name and the image remain in the same vertical alignment with identical spacing. There is also no visible "description" text associated with the product name or image to adjust, which might be a missing element in the design itself, but even without it, the core instruction regarding the name and image positioning was not fulfilled.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
