Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims for two specific visual changes concerning the "main navigation links at the top of the page":
    *   Increase the text size of these links.
    *   Add more space between each of these navigation items for better readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, the main navigation links (Inici, Xemeneies, Xemeneies a mida, etc.) are presented as a vertical list in a sidebar.
    *   In the "after" image, these same links have been repositioned to the very top of the page, forming a horizontal navigation bar.
    *   **Text Size:** Comparing the text "Inici" or "Xemeneies" from the sidebar in the "before" image to their counterparts in the horizontal bar in the "after" image, it is clearly visible that the text size has been significantly increased.
    *   **Space Between Items:** In the "after" image, there is a distinct and generous amount of horizontal space added between each navigation item (e.g., between "Inici" and "Xemeneies", or "Xemeneies" and "Xemeneies a mida"). This is a clear improvement in spacing compared to their original vertical, more compact layout.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction referred to "main navigation links at the top of the page." While in the "before" image they were not *at the top*, the "after" image clearly establishes them as the main navigation *at the top of the page* and applies the changes to them. This implies a successful interpretation and application of the instruction's intent regarding *which* links to target and *where* they should ultimately reside.
    *   Both parts of the instruction – increasing text size and adding space – are clearly and unambiguously implemented. No elements seem to be missing from the requested changes.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
