**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the visual presentation of the address blocks in the footer. This involves two key aspects:
    *   **Neat Alignment:** Ensuring that the address blocks and the text within them are visually organized and line up correctly.
    *   **Consistent Spacing:** Applying uniform space both between the separate address blocks (Centelles, Barcelona, Sabadell, Mataró) and within the individual lines of text *inside* each address block, specifically to prevent a "cramped together" appearance.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible, primarily concerning the spacing within the address blocks.
    *   **Improved Vertical Spacing (Line Height):** In the "after" image, there is a noticeable increase in the vertical space (line height) between the lines of text within each address block (e.g., between the street address, postal code, and phone numbers). This provides more breathing room for the text, making it appear significantly less cramped compared to the "before" image. For example, observe the space between "08540 (Centelles)" and "93 889 84 29" under the "Centelles" heading – it's clearly larger in the "after" version.
    *   **Alignment:** The general alignment of the blocks and the left alignment of the text within each block remain consistent and appear neat, supporting the "neatly aligned" aspect of the instruction. The horizontal spacing between the major address blocks (Centelles, Barcelona, Sabadell, Mataró) was already reasonable and remains consistent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The most critical part of the instruction, which was to ensure the blocks "don't appear cramped together" through "consistent spacing," has been directly and effectively addressed by increasing the line height within each address block. The alignment was largely acceptable beforehand and remains so, contributing to the "neatly aligned" requirement.
