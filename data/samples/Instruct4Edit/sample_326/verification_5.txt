**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests that the "Configuració" and "Guardar configuració" buttons, specifically within the cookie settings pop-up, be given a softer, more rounded, pill-style shape. This means their corners should be much more curved, approximating an oval or capsule shape.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. The "Configuració" button in the cookie banner, which is a target of this instruction, retains the exact same shape in the "after" image as it has in the "before" image. It remains a rectangle with slightly rounded corners, not a pill-style button. The "Guardar configuració" button is not visible in either the "before" or "after" initial view of the cookie banner, so its state cannot be assessed. However, the visible "Configuració" button shows no transformation to a "softer, more rounded shape, like pill-style."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts. The most prominent target button, "Configuració," shows absolutely no visual change to its shape. It looks identical in both images regarding its corners and overall form. The "Guardar configuració" button is not present in the visible part of the cookie banner in either image, preventing verification of that specific element. Based on the visible and explicitly mentioned "Configuració" button, the instruction appears to be completely unapplied.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
