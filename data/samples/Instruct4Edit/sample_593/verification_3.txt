Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the main navigation menu. This is meant to visually separate the navigation menu from the content below it.
2. Comparing the two images, I can't see any shadow added to the main navigation menu.
3. I don't see any change between the two images in regards to the instruction.

Final verdict:
