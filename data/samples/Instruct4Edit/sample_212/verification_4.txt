Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the spacing between the listed items in the "products" section. This refers to the list of product names in the first section "Курсы обучения 1С в Мариуполе."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The spacing between the listed items in the "products" section has visibly increased.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict: ✅ Fully Applied**
