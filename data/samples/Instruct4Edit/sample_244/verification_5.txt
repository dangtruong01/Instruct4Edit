Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to make the social sharing buttons significantly less prominent and visually "loud." This was to be achieved by making them smaller, displaying only their respective icons (without text labels), and removing their distinct solid, colored backgrounds to give them a more neutral and subtle appearance.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible and significant.
    *   **Less Obtrusive:** The overall visual weight of the buttons has been drastically reduced. They no longer draw as much attention.
    *   **Smaller:** The new circular buttons are noticeably smaller in size compared to the original rectangular ones.
    *   **Showing Only Icons:** In the "before" image, the buttons showed both an icon and text (e.g., "Facebook", "Twitter"). In the "after" image, only the social media icons are present within the circles.
    *   **Removed Solid, Colored Backgrounds:** The "before" image had buttons with solid, brand-specific colored backgrounds (e.g., blue for Facebook, red for Google+). In the "after" image, these solid colored backgrounds have been removed, replaced by a subtle outline and greyed-out icons, making them appear transparent against the page background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. All aspects of the instruction — making them less obtrusive, smaller, showing only icons, and removing solid colored backgrounds — have been clearly and fully implemented in the "after" image. The redesign perfectly aligns with the given instructions.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
