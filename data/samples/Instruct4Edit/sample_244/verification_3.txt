As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the "before" and "after" images against the provided instruction.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to add two distinct visual elements to the job posting image:
    *   A "soft, light-colored border" around the image.
    *   A "slight shadow" around the image.
    The combined purpose of these changes is to give the image "more definition" and "help it stand out" from the background.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Border:** In the "before" image, the job posting image directly abuts the white background with no visible border. In the "after" image, a very thin, light grey line is discernible around the entire perimeter of the job posting image. This border is indeed "soft" (not harsh or thick) and "light-colored" (a very subtle light grey). While extremely subtle and almost blends with the background, it is visually present upon careful comparison, particularly when zooming in.
    *   **Shadow:** In the "before" image, there is no shadow around the job posting image. In the "after" image, a faint, diffuse shadow is visible, especially along the bottom and right edges of the image. This shadow is clearly "slight" as instructed, and it successfully provides a subtle sense of depth, making the image appear slightly lifted and thus helping it to stand out.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There are no missing elements; both the border and the shadow have been added.
    *   The primary point of caution lies with the extreme subtlety of the border. While it meets the criteria of "soft" and "light-colored," its minimal contrast against the white background means it contributes only very marginally to "more definition" or "help it stand out" for a casual viewer. It is technically present, but its visual impact is minimal. The shadow, however, is clear and effectively contributes to the image standing out. Given the instruction specified "add" and the elements are present as described, the implementation is technically complete, even if the border's effect is very understated.
