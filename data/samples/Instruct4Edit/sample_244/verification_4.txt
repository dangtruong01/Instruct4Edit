As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the two images provided, focusing solely on visual changes related to vertical spacing.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction mandates an *increase* in vertical spacing. This means adding more vertical whitespace (through margins, padding, or line-height adjustments) in several key areas:
    *   Between the main article content (left column) and the sections within the sidebar (right column).
    *   Between the main article content and the elements located directly above it (e.g., breadcrumbs, title).
    *   Between the main article content and the elements located directly below it (e.g., social share buttons, general footer elements).
    The overall goal is to provide "more visual breathing room" by making the content appear less dense vertically.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison, no discernible increase in vertical spacing is visible in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

    *   **Main article content and sidebar sections:**
        *   The vertical spacing *between* the job listings in the sidebar (e.g., between "Lowongan Kerja Rumah Sakit..." and "Lowongan Kerja Hotel...") remains identical.
        *   The vertical spacing *within* the main article content (e.g., between the article title and date, between paragraphs/lists in "Info Lowongan Kerja", between the image and "Info Lowongan Kerja") shows no change.
        *   The overall vertical footprint of the main content column and the sidebar column appears unchanged relative to each other, indicating no added vertical padding or margin to their containers that would create "more breathing room" between them vertically.

    *   **Main article and elements directly above it:**
        *   The vertical space between the breadcrumbs ("BERANDA / 2020 /...") and the article title ("Lowongan Kerja SDIT Tarbawi") is exactly the same.
        *   The vertical space between the article title and the date ("Sabtu, Desember 12, 2020") is also identical.

    *   **Main article and elements directly below it:**
        *   The vertical space between the social sharing buttons ("Berbagi") and the "WIDGET HTML #3" section below it is unchanged.
        *   The vertical space between "WIDGET HTML #3" and the very bottom site footer ("MENU HALAMAN STATIS") is also identical.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the absence of the instructed changes. The "after" image appears to be a pixel-for-pixel identical copy of the "before" image in terms of the requested vertical spacing adjustments. No aspect of the instruction related to increasing vertical spacing has been implemented.
