As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images based on the provided instruction.

**Instruction:** Adjust the alignment of the detailed job requirements and contact information within the main article so that all the text is aligned to the left side of the page for improved readability.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends for specific text elements (detailed job requirements like "POSISI," "SYARAT," and contact information) to be horizontally aligned to the left side of the page. The word "Adjust" implies that these elements might not currently be left-aligned and need to be moved to achieve this alignment.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close inspection of both the "before" and "after" images, the "POSISI," "SYARAT," and the contact information ("Lamaran ditunggu paling lambat," and "Kirim lamaran lengkap dan CV ke...") sections are already consistently left-aligned with the main content area in the "before" image. There is no discernible shift or alteration in their horizontal alignment in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is an ambiguity regarding the interpretation of "Adjust." If the instruction implies a *modification* from a non-left-aligned state to a left-aligned state, then no such adjustment was visually applied because the text was already left-aligned. If the instruction was merely to *ensure* the text is left-aligned (and it already was), then no visual change would occur. As a reviewer focused on *visual implementation* of an *adjustment*, the lack of a visible change indicates the instruction (as a directive for change) was not implemented.
