Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the main navigation bar to be a solid, slightly darker yellow, replacing the current lighter, semi-transparent yellow.
2. By comparing the before and after images, the yellow navigation bar appears to be identical in both images. There's no visible darkening, nor has the transparency been removed.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
