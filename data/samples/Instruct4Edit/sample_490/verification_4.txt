Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow effect to be added to the main title "Offener Tarotabend." This should visually lift the title off the page a little.
2. I have compared the two images, focusing on the title "Offener Tarotabend". I cannot detect any shadow effect added in the second image that wasn't present in the first. The title appears identical in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
