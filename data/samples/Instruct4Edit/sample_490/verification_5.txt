Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires a decrease in the margin between the event image and the event details/description. This means the space separating the image on the left from the text on the right, and/or the space between the image and the text beneath it, should be smaller in the "after" image.
2. By visually comparing the two images, I can see that the space between the image and the text on the right *appears* to be slightly smaller in the "after" image. However, it is very difficult to be certain without precise measurements. The space between the image and the description beneath is similar in both images.
3. Due to the very subtle difference, it is hard to be absolutely sure whether the change was implemented intentionally or if it's due to other factors.
