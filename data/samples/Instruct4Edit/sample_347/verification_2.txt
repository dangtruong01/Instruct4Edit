Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests adding a subtle shadow to the header of the page. The header is the topmost part containing "FINANCE HRM MANAGEMENT MARKETING OPERATIONS".
2. By comparing the two images, there is no visible shadow added to the header in the modified image. The header remains visually identical to the original image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, and the shadow is not present.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
