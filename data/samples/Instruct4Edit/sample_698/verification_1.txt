Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the blue border around the content areas to a lighter and less saturated shade of blue.
2. Comparing the two images, I can not perceive any visible change in the blue border. It seems identical in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change was not visually implemented in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
