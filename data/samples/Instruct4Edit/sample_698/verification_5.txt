Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the font size of navigation links and add a subtle background highlight on hover.
2. The "after" image shows navigation links at the top with a different background color and readable "Link 1", "Link 2", "Link 3", "Link 4", "Link 5", "Link 6" labels. These links were not present in the "before" image.
3. We can see the increased font size and different background color for the navigation bar in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. There is no hover effect in the static image, so we can't verify that part of the instruction.

Final verdict:
