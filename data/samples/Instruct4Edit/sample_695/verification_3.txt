Here's the detailed review:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to change the two action buttons, "Richtungen" and "Fotos," from their original appearance (likely a blue border with blue text/icons and a light or transparent fill) to a solid primary blue background with white text and icons. The rounded corners of the buttons were to be retained.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, both "Richtungen" and "Fotos" buttons have a blue border and blue text/icons, with what appears to be a light or transparent background fill.
    *   In the "after" image, both buttons are distinctly filled with a solid blue color (consistent with the brand's primary blue), and their text ("Richtungen," "Fotos") and respective icons (compass and camera) are now white.
    *   Crucially, the rounded corners of both buttons are preserved in the "after" image, as instructed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. The instruction was precise, and all aspects – changing the fill to primary blue, changing text/icons to white, and keeping rounded corners – have been clearly implemented in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
