**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requires that for any "currently selected item in the navigation menus," two conditions should be met:
    *   Its text color should already be changed (which is presented as a pre-existing condition or an accompanying change).
    *   A "clear visual indicator like a thin line underneath it" must be added.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Observation of "Urlaub Planen" in the main navigation bar:** In both the "before" and "after" images, "Urlaub Planen" is displayed in blue text, indicating it is the selected item. In the "after" image, a clear, thin blue line has been added directly underneath "Urlaub Planen". This line is completely absent in the "before" image.
    *   **Observation of "Tourist Faaborg" in the top-right navigation bar:** Similarly, "Tourist Faaborg" is displayed in blue text in both images. In the "after" image, a clear, thin blue line has been added directly underneath "Tourist Faaborg", which was not present in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The visual indicators (thin lines) are clearly present under both selected navigation items in the "after" image and match the specified criteria (thin line, underneath, clear visual indicator, in addition to text color change). The change is unambiguous and consistent across all selected navigation items.

**Final verdict:**
