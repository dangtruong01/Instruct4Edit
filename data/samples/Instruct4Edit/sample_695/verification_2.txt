Here's a step-by-step justification of the visual changes:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two primary visual changes:
    *   The prominent hero image (the beach scene) should be adjusted to span the full width available within the main content area.
    *   The title "Spielplatz - Klinten" along with its associated action buttons ("Richtungen", "Fotos") should be repositioned to appear directly beneath the expanded hero image and be horizontally centered.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Hero Image Width:** In the "before" image, the hero image occupies only a portion of the main content width, with a blue information panel to its right. In the "after" image, the hero image has clearly expanded horizontally to fill the entire width previously taken by both the image and the blue panel. It now spans the full width of the main content area.
    *   **Title and Buttons Positioning:** In the "before" image, the title "Spielplatz - Klinten" and its buttons are located inside a blue box to the right of the hero image. In the "after" image, this blue box containing the title and buttons has been moved from beside the image to directly underneath it.
    *   **Centering:** The blue box containing the title and buttons is visibly horizontally centered relative to the width of the expanded hero image and the main content area. The content within this blue box (the title and the buttons) is also centered.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction "full width available" refers to the content area, which the image now fills. The "centered directly beneath the image" aspect is also clearly visible, with the entire information block positioned horizontally in the middle below the image. All aspects of the instruction appear to be fully and clearly implemented.

**Final verdict:**
