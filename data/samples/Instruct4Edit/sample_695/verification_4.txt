**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between the blue horizontal bar containing the text "Share Your Wonders on:" and the section immediately below it, which includes the footer links like "Infos und Fotos" and "Zugang". This is intended to create better visual separation and improve readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the gap between the blue bar and the footer links is relatively small. In the "after" image, a significant amount of additional white space has been introduced directly below the blue "Share Your Wonders on:" bar and above the "Infos und Fotos" / "Zugang" sections. This successfully increases the vertical separation.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The added vertical space is distinct and directly addresses the instruction. The instruction was simple and clearly implemented.
