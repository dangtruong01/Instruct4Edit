Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the side navigation slide in quicker. This implies a change in animation speed. Since the animation cannot be observed through static images, it's impossible to visually confirm if this instruction was applied.
2. Since there's no visual difference between the before and after images, it's impossible to tell if the animation speed has been altered.
3. The missing element is the ability to perceive the animation. Static images cannot convey animation speed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
