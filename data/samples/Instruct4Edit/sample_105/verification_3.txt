Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to apply rounded corners to the advertising banner. The advertising banner is the image in the center.
2. Comparing the two images, there's no visible difference in the corners of the central image. They remain sharp, as they were in the original image.
3. There are no rounded corners in the modified image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
