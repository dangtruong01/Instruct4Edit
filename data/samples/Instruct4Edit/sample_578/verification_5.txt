Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the header image responsive. This means that on smaller screens, the header image should scale down in size.
2. The header image in both images appears to be the same size. Without seeing the images at different screen sizes, it is impossible to verify the responsiveness of the header image.
3. The instruction is clear, but its implementation cannot be visually confirmed from the provided images alone.

Final verdict:
