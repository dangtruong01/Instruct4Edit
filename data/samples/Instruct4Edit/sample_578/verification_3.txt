Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the spacing between the page title ("Meet Free Monday with a Twist") and the main content (the paragraph starting with "Hi. How was your weekend? It's Meet Free Monday time...").
2. Comparing the two images, the space between the title and the text appears visually unchanged.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
