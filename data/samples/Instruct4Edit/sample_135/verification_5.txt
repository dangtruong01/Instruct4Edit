Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for an increase in empty space (padding/margin) around the main heading ("NWSPPRS.COM"), around the large block of description text (the long list of URLs), and between distinct sections of the page (e.g., between the heading and the first text block, between different title/paragraph groups, and between the main content and the footer). The goal is to make the layout feel less cluttered.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison, there are no visible changes in the amount of empty space in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
    *   The space above and below the main heading "NWSPPRS.COM" remains identical.
    *   The space surrounding the long list of URLs (description paragraphs) – specifically, the space between "Short URL" and the list, and between the list and "Add the Bookmarklet" – appears unchanged.
    *   The spacing between all distinct sections (e.g., "NWSPPRS.COM" and "URL has been shortened", "URL has been shortened" and the URL, the URL list and "Add the Bookmarklet", "Add the Bookmarklet" and the copyright footer) remains exactly the same.
    *   The line height within the text blocks also appears unchanged.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction appears to be entirely unapplied visually. The "after" image presents the exact same layout and spacing as the "before" image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
