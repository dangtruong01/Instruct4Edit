Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requires the primary website name "NWSPPRS.COM" at the top to have both its "NWSPPRS" and ".COM" parts display in a single, unified, deep color. Previously, it had two different shades of blue.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, "NWSPPRS" is a lighter blue, while ".COM" is a distinct, darker blue.
    *   In the "after" image, both "NWSPPRS" and ".COM" are rendered in the exact same dark blue color. This color is also deeper than the original lighter blue used for "NWSPPRS", fulfilling the "deep color" requirement.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The change is unambiguous. Both parts of the name are now visually identical in color, and the chosen color is deeper than the original lighter part, thus appearing more unified and professional.

**Final verdict:**
