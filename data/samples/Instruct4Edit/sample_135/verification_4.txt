**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction has two main parts for the "shorten w/ nwspprs" button:
    *   Soften its corners (e.g., by adding a border-radius).
    *   Apply a slight visual depth, making it look more like a clickable element (e.g., through a subtle shadow, gradient, or slight emboss effect).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Softening corners:** Upon very close inspection, the corners of the "shorten w/ nwspprs" button in the "after" image appear to have an *extremely* subtle rounding compared to the sharp, 90-degree corners in the "before" image. This change is barely perceptible and requires zooming in significantly.
    *   **Applying slight visual depth:** No, there is no discernible visual depth added to the button. It remains visually flat, identical to the "before" state in terms of perceived depth. There is no visible shadow, gradient, or other effect that would make it appear more raised or "clickable" in the sense of having depth.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements. While a minuscule attempt might have been made at softening the corners (it's so subtle it's almost imperceptible), the instruction to "apply a slight visual depth, making it look more like a clickable element" has clearly not been implemented at all. The button appears just as flat as it did before the "design change." To convey "visual depth" for a clickable element, one would typically expect a subtle box-shadow, a gradient that suggests a light source, or a slight border alteration – none of which are present.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
