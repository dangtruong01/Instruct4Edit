As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images against the provided instruction.

---

**Instruction:** Update the appearance of the main content box by removing its outside border and changing its background to a clean white.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended two distinct visual modifications to the main content box:
    *   The removal of any existing outside border.
    *   A change in its background color to a specific "clean white."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Border Removal:** Yes, in the "before" image, the main content box clearly has a thin, light grey border. In the "after" image, this border is completely absent. This part of the instruction has been fully and clearly implemented.
    *   **Background Color Change to Clean White:** No discernible visual change is observed. Upon close inspection and color sampling, the background color of the main content box in the "before" image is already pure white (#FFFFFF). The background color in the "after" image remains pure white (#FFFFFF). Therefore, while the background *is* "clean white" in the modified version, no actual *change* in background color has occurred, as it was already in the desired state.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is an ambiguity regarding the "changing its background to a clean white" part of the instruction. As a visual reviewer, my assessment is based on observable changes. Since the background of the content box was already pure white in the original design, the action of "changing" it to clean white could not be visually demonstrated or confirmed as a transformation. While the final state (a clean white background) is met, the *action* of "changing" it was not visibly applied. This means that a portion of the instructed *update* (the "change" aspect of the background) was not visibly implemented, as it was redundant.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied

**Reasoning:** Although the removal of the border was successfully and clearly applied, the instruction included a second critical component: "changing its background to a clean white." Since the background was already clean white in the "before" state, no visual "change" occurred for this part of the instruction. As a cautious reviewer, if an instructed visual change is not visually demonstrable, the instruction cannot be considered "fully and clearly implemented" as written, especially when it specifies an *action* like "changing."
