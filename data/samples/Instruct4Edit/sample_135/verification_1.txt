Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to make the "extensive list of approved web addresses" appear less dominant. Two possible methods were suggested: making its text smaller, or placing it inside a scrollable box.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, the list of web addresses is very long, occupying a significant portion of the page, making it highly dominant.
    *   In the "after" image, the list's visual footprint is significantly reduced. It is contained within a grey box, and only the beginning portion of the list is visible. This indeed makes the list *appear* less dominant on the page.
    *   However, regarding the suggested methods:
        *   The text of the list does *not* appear to be smaller in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
        *   While the list is placed inside a box, there are *no visible scrollbars* (vertical or horizontal) on this box. This means it is not visually clear that it is a "scrollable box" that allows access to the rest of the "extensive list". It simply appears as a truncated list within a box.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements from a visual UI/UX perspective.
    *   The instruction provided specific *methods* ("making its text smaller or placing it inside a scrollable box") to achieve the goal of reduced dominance.
    *   Neither of these methods is clearly and fully implemented visually. The text is not smaller. The box, while present, does not *visually convey* that it is scrollable due to the complete absence of scrollbars. As a cautious reviewer, a box containing truncated content without visible scrollbars is a common usability issue, as it hides content without providing clear cues for interaction. The "extensive list" mentioned in the instruction implies that the *entire* list should still be accessible, albeit in a less dominant display. The current visual implementation does not clearly confirm this accessibility.

**Final verdict:**
