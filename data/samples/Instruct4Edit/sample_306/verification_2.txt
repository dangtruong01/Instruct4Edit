Step-by-step justification:
1.  The intended visual change is to increase the space between the main content area and the sidebar.
2.  Comparing the "before" and "after" images, it's difficult to discern a clear increase in the space. The space appears nearly identical in both images.
3.  The instruction is clear, but the visual change is not apparent.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
