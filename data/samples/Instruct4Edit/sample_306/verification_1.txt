Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to darken the shade of gray used for the navigation menu items.
2. The navigation menu items are at the top of the page and at the bottom. Comparing the two images, the shade of gray appears to be negligibly darker or the change is not visible.
3. There is doubt as to whether the change has been applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
