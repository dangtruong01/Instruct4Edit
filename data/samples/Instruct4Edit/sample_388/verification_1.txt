Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the size and boldness of the site title in the header.
2. Comparing the two images, the site title "Constitució espanyola de 1812" at the bottom of the page, not in the header, appears visually similar in both images, so the instruction wasn't applied to it. There's no visible site title in the header.
3. I can't detect any changes in size or boldness in the header, or any place the title might be located.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
