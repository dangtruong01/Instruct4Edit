Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the image captions. This means a thin, light-colored border should be applied around the text that describes each image.
2. Looking at the "after" image, there is no visible border around either of the image captions ("Constitucio de 1812" and "La promulgació de la Constitució de 1812...").
3. There is no visible change, and the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
