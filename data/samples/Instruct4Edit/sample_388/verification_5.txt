Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the "Deixa un comentari" heading smaller and less prominent. This implies a reduction in font size and/or a change in font weight or color to make it less visually striking.
2. Comparing the two images, the "Deixa un comentari" heading appears to be slightly smaller in the second image. Also the font seems slightly lighter.
3. I'm confident that a slight size and prominence reduction was applied.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
