Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states two clear changes for the 'Nieuwsmelder' title:
    *   It should receive a distinct, darker background color.
    *   Its text color should change to white for better contrast.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Background Color:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the 'Nieuwsmelder' title appears without any distinct background color. It remains transparent, blending with the page's white background.
    *   **Text Color:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the 'Nieuwsmelder' text remains black.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. Neither of the instructed changes (darker background or white text) has been applied. The 'Nieuwsmelder' element appears visually identical in both images.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
