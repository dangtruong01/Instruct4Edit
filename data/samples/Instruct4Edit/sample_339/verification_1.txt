Here's the detailed comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that when a user hovers over an item in the primary navigation bar (e.g., "Drenthe", "Groningen", "Overijssel", "Friesland", "Info"), its background color should change to a lighter shade.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Both the "before" and "after" images provided are visually identical. There is no element in the "after" image that shows a changed (lighter) background color, simulating a hover state, compared to the "before" image. To demonstrate this instruction, the "after" image would need to show at least one navigation item with a distinct lighter background, as if it were being hovered over.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the core issue is that the "after" image fails to visually represent the instructed change. The instruction describes an interactive state (hover) that should result in a visual change (lighter background). Since the two images are exactly the same, and neither depicts an item in a hover state, there is no visual evidence that the instruction has been implemented.
