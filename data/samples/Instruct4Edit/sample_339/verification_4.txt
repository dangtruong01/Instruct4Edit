Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Increase the font size of the caption text located directly below the main article image ("Foto/Video – Fabian Grave Persbureau Meter").
    *   Add a small amount of extra vertical space between the bottom of the main article image and the top of the aforementioned caption text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size Increase:** Yes, the text "Foto/Video – Fabian Grave/Persbureau Meter" (note: a slash was added in the 'after' image, though not part of the instruction) is visibly larger in the 'after' image compared to the 'before' image.
    *   **Extra Space Above:** Yes, there is a clear, small vertical gap introduced between the bottom edge of the main image and the caption text in the 'after' image, which was not present in the 'before' image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The font size increase is clear, although it's a subtle increment, it fulfills the "increase" requirement.
    *   The "small amount of extra space" is also clearly visible and applied as requested.
    *   *Minor observation:* The text changed slightly from "Foto/Video – Fabian Grave Persbureau Meter" (before) to "Foto/Video – Fabian Grave/Persbureau Meter" (after) by adding a slash. While this is a text content change and not directly related to the *visual* instruction of font size or spacing, it's worth noting as a discrepancy if the instruction was purely visual. However, focusing solely on the visual aspects of font size and spacing, the instruction was followed.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
