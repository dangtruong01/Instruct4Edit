Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to enhance the visual styling of the search bar's text input field by adding:
    *   A subtle light gray border.
    *   Gently rounded corners.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Subtle light gray border:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the search input field has a very faint, almost black or dark gray default border. There is no visible change to a "subtle light gray" border in the "after" image. The border appears identical in both states.
    *   **Gently rounded corners:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the corners of the search input field are sharp, 90-degree angles. There are no discernible rounded corners applied in the "after" image. The corners appear identical in both states.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; both requested changes—the subtle light gray border and the gently rounded corners—are completely absent from the "after" image. The search bar's styling is visually identical in both the "before" and "after" states.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
