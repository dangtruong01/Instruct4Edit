Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies adding a 'back to top' arrow icon. This icon should be enclosed within a solid, dark circular button, and this button should appear to float on the screen. A 'back to top' arrow typically refers to an upward-pointing arrow (e.g., ↑ or ⬆).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In the "after" image, a new UI element is visible in the middle-right area, overlaying the main image content. This element is a dark, solid, circular shape, which appears to be a button. Inside this button, there is an arrow icon. The button is positioned in a way that suggests it is "floating" over the content.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant doubt regarding the type of arrow icon used. The instruction explicitly asks for a "'back to top' arrow icon." A 'back to top' arrow is conventionally an upward-pointing arrow. However, the arrow icon implemented in the "after" image is a right-pointing arrow (→). This direction typically signifies "next," "forward," or "read more," not "back to top." While the button's properties (solid, dark, circular, floating) are implemented, the specific and crucial detail of the *type* of arrow icon, as conveyed by its common UI/UX meaning, has been misinterpreted or incorrectly applied. The instruction's core intent for the *function* of the icon ("back to top") is directly contradicted by its visual representation (a right arrow).

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
