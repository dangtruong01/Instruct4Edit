Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a light gray border to the "tag elements". Based on the image, the tag elements are the words such as "firme", "determinado", etc., located at the bottom of the image.
2. Comparing the before and after images, I cannot see any light gray border around these tag elements.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction, and the tag elements are clearly identifiable in the images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
