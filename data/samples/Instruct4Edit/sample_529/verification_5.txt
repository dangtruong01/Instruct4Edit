❌ Not Applied

Justification:
1. The instruction is to center the navigation links in the header on larger screens. There is no header or navigation links visible in either image.
2. Without a header or any navigation links, it is impossible to assess if the change was made.
3. Therefore, the instruction cannot be verified.

Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied
