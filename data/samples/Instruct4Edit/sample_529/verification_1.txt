**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **Intended visual change:** The purple header at the top of the page should extend to the very left and right edges of the screen, eliminating any existing padding.
2.  **Is the change visible?** Comparing the two images, I cannot detect any purple header.
3.  **Are there any doubts or missing elements?** The instruction refers to a "purple header." However, there is no visible purple header in either the "before" or "after" images.

**Final verdict:**

‚ùå Not Applied. The instruction mentions a purple header that does not appear in the images. Therefore, it's impossible to confirm whether the requested change was implemented.
