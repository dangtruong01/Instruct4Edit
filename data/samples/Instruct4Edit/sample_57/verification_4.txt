Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction asks to round the corners of the "Submit" button, which is the rectangular button below the comment form.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The button in both images appear to have squared corners. There is no clear rounding of the corners in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
