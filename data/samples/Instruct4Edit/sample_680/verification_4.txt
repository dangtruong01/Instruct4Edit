Here's my review based on your instructions:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to make the page numbering and navigation links at the bottom of the document list visually more prominent and interactive. This includes:
*   Making them "distinct and clickable" in appearance.
*   Potentially adding a "subtle border or background" to these elements.
*   Clearly highlighting or indicating the "current page".

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible:
*   **Before:** The pagination links ("首页", "1页", "下1页", "尾页") are plain text, appearing as simple static information.
*   **After:**
    *   The text "1页" has been changed to just "1".
    *   The text "下1页" has been changed to "下页".
    *   All navigation links ("首页", "上页", "下页", "尾页") now have a light grey background and a subtle border, making them look like distinct, clickable buttons.
    *   The current page number "1" is prominently displayed with a contrasting red background and white text, clearly indicating its active status.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities.
*   The elements are indeed more distinct and appear clickable due to the added backgrounds and borders.
*   The current page is very clearly indicated by the red background.
*   The "subtle border or background" suggestion was implemented effectively with the light grey boxes.

**Final verdict:**
