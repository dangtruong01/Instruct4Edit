**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to change the current prominent red background highlighting the active menu item ("信息公开" in this case) to a more subtle indicator. Examples provided for subtlety are "a thicker underline" or "a softer shade" (implying a softer background color). The core idea is to reduce the visual dominance of the active state indicator.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, "信息公开" has a solid, prominent red background, making it stand out significantly.
    *   In the "after" image, the solid red background behind "信息公开" has been removed. Instead, "信息公开" is now marked with a distinct, thick red underline. This directly matches one of the suggested "subtle indicator" types (a thicker underline).

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction explicitly provided "a thicker underline" as an example of a more subtle indicator, and this is precisely what has been implemented. The original background highlight has been removed, fulfilling the "change the highlighted background color" part of the instruction. The new indicator is demonstrably more subtle than a full background block.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
