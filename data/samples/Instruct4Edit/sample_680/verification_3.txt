As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I will compare the two images against the given instruction.

**Instruction:** "Add more vertical space between each document title and its corresponding date in the main list, and make the date text slightly smaller or a lighter color."

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   **Part 1: Vertical space:** To increase the vertical separation between the document title (the Chinese text) and its corresponding date (e.g., "2023-09-21"). In the "before" image, the date appears on the same line immediately after the title. The instruction implies either moving the date to a new line below the title with added spacing, or somehow increasing the line height to create more vertical room around the title-date pair if they remain inline.
    *   **Part 2: Date text appearance:** To make the date text less prominent. This should be achieved by either reducing its font size or changing its color to a lighter shade (e.g., gray instead of black).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Part 1: Vertical space:** No. In the "after" image, the dates have been moved from immediately following the title on the same line to a new, separate column aligned to the far right of the page. This is a significant *horizontal* layout change to separate the elements, not an addition of *vertical* space between them. The title and date remain on the same horizontal line.
    *   **Part 2: Date text appearance:** No. Comparing the date text in the "after" image to the "before" image, there is no discernible change in either font size or color. The dates appear to be the same size and black (or very dark gray) as before.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   Yes, there is ambiguity in the interpretation of "Add more vertical space between" when the elements (title and date) were initially horizontally aligned on the same line. A literal interpretation would require the date to move *below* the title. The chosen solution (moving the date to a new far-right column) is a different kind of separation – horizontal and columnar – which does not fulfill the "vertical space" requirement.
    *   The second part of the instruction ("make the date text slightly smaller or a lighter color") was completely missed; no visual change in size or color of the date text is evident.
