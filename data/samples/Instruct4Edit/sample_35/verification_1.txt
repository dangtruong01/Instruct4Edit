Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to change the header's background color to a slightly darker shade of the current white.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The header's background is not obviously and visibly darker in the "after" image. It remains the same white.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the change is not applied.

**Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied**
