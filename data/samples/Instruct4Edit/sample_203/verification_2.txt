Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for two visual changes: 1) the navigation bar spanning the full width of the page, and 2) the navigation bar having a slightly rounded bottom edge.
2. By comparing the "after" image with the "before" image, the navigation bar's width has NOT changed. The navigation bar still doesn't span the full width of the page. Also, the bottom edge of the navigation bar still has sharp corners.
3. Both parts of the instruction seem to be missing from the modified image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
