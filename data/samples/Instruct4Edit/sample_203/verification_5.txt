Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the website name "The Clemson Insider Forums" more prominent in the breadcrumb navigation, suggesting either making it bolder or using a slightly larger font size.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no visual difference in the appearance of the website name "TheClemsonInsider.com" at the very bottom. It has neither been made bolder nor is the font size increased.
3. The website name that the prompt is referring to doesn't exist in either image, but there is one at the bottom of both images. The instruction isn't fulfilled for the one on the bottom.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
