Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the font size within the user profile statistics boxes.
2. Upon comparing the two images, there's no visible change in the font size within the "Statistics", "Mini Statistics", "Recent Visitors", and "Contact Info" boxes. The font size appears to be the same in both images.
3. There's no ambiguity in the instruction, but it hasn't been implemented.

Final verdict:
