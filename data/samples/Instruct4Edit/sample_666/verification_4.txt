Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction specifies making the main content title, "Illumination-konnzatu", visually larger and more impactful. This typically implies an increase in font size and potentially font weight (boldness) or other stylistic changes to enhance its prominence.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the text "Illumination-konnzatu" (the main heading below the navigation bar) in the "after" image is visibly larger in font size and appears to have increased in font weight (bolder) compared to the "before" image. This change clearly makes it more prominent and impactful. The second instance of "Illumination-konnzatu" (further down the page, below the large white box) has remained unchanged, which aligns with the instruction targeting the "main content title" specifically.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
None. The change is precisely applied to the intended element and clearly fulfills both aspects of the instruction: "larger" and "more impactful."

**Final verdict:**
