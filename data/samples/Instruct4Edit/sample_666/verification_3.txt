**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for a "subtle, light border around each of the recent article entries in the sidebar." This refers to the list of articles under "最新の投稿" (Recent Posts). The expectation is that each individual article item (comprising an image, title, and date) will be enclosed by a thin, light-colored border.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the recent article entries are listed with only thin horizontal lines separating them, but no border surrounds each individual entry.
    *   In the "after" image, each article entry (the thumbnail, title, and date combined) is now enclosed within a distinct, very thin, light gray border. This border visually separates and defines each entry as a distinct block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The border is consistently applied to *each* recent article entry. It is indeed "subtle" (not thick or dark) and "light" (a light gray color). The implementation perfectly matches the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
