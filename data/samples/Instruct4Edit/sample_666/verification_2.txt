**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to increase the horizontal spacing between the main navigation links located at the top of the page. This implies that the individual navigation items ("ホーム", "課金対象投稿", "画像について", "お問い合わせ", "サイトマップ") should appear further apart from each other in the "after" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, it is evident that the horizontal gaps between the navigation links in the top menu bar have significantly increased. The links now appear more spread out horizontally, indicating that more space has been added between them.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was specific to horizontal spacing between main navigation links, and the visual modification in the "after" image precisely reflects this change, with a clear and consistent increase in spacing across all relevant links.

**Final verdict:**
