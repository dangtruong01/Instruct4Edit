Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies rounding the corners of three distinct navigation buttons: 'Previous Image' ('前のイメージ'), 'Home' ('ホーム'), and 'Next Image' ('次のイメージ'). This means transforming their current sharp, 90-degree corners into smooth, curved corners.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the 'before' image, the corners of the '前のイメージ', 'ホーム', and '次のイメージ' buttons are sharp and angular. In the 'after' image, the corners of these identical three buttons have been consistently rounded, making them appear softer and less rectangular. The rounding is applied to all four corners of each button.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements regarding the implementation of this specific instruction. All three designated buttons have had their corners rounded, and the change is clear and uniform across them.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
