Here's my review based on the instruction provided:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to make "the area containing the main blog title and its description" more visually prominent by applying a "distinct background color." On this page, there are two potential interpretations for "main blog title":
    *   The overall blog site title: "生活役立ちブログ" (located at the very top). Its description is "日々の生活の中で役に立つ情報を中心に作成して綴っています。".
    *   The current blog post title: "Illumination-konnzatu" (the larger, centered text within the main content area). No explicit description is visible for this specific title.
    Given standard UI/UX terminology, "main blog title" typically refers to the overall blog's name. Therefore, the intended change is to apply a distinct background color to the area containing "生活役立ちブログ" and its tagline.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the entire top section of the page, including "生活役立ちブログ" and its description, has a white background. In the "after" image, this specific area has been changed to a light gray background color. This new background color is distinct from the white background of the navigation bar and the rest of the page content, making the area visually prominent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The primary ambiguity lies in the interpretation of "main blog title" as discussed in point 1. However, assuming "main blog title" refers to the overall blog's name, the instruction has been clearly and fully implemented for that area. The applied color is distinct, and it clearly makes the specified area more prominent. No elements mentioned in the instruction are missing from the implementation.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
