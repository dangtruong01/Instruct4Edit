Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to apply a subtle background color specifically to the "comment section" (the area containing "Submit a Comment" and related text) to make it visually stand out from the white background of the main article content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. In both the "before" and "after" images, the "Submit a Comment" section has a plain white background, which is the same as the overall page background. There is no discernible difference in its background color between the two images, nor does it appear visually distinct due to a new background color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction to add a subtle background color to the comment section to make it visually distinct has not been implemented. The section remains visually indistinguishable from the rest of the white page background in the "after" image, just as it was in the "before" image.

**Final verdict:**
