Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Change the background color of the very bottom section of the page (the footer) to a darker shade to provide a clear visual break.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to visually distinguish the very bottom section of the page (the footer, which in this case appears to be the "Submit a Comment" area) from the rest of the page content by applying a darker background color to it. This darker shade should create a "clear visual break."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. In both the "before" and "after" images, the background color of the "Submit a Comment" section and the text "You must be logged in to post a comment." remains white. There is no difference in the background shade between the two images for this section.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction specifies a color change to a "darker shade" for the footer to provide a "clear visual break." No such change has occurred; the background remains identical (white) in both states.
