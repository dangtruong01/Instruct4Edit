**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing below the large main image. This additional space should separate the main image from any elements that follow it, such as descriptive text or smaller images. The goal is to create "ample" vertical space, implying a noticeable increase in the gap.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the vertical space between the large main image and the smaller thumbnail image below it appears to be identical. Similarly, the space between the smaller image and the "Submit a Comment" heading also shows no discernible change. There is no perceptible increase in vertical separation in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the lack of visual change. The instruction specifies "ample vertical space" and requires the change to be "clearly implemented." Since there is no visible alteration in the vertical spacing whatsoever, the instruction has not been fulfilled visually.
