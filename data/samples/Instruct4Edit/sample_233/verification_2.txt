Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Increase the size and weight of the main article title to make it stand out more.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main article title, "He has prepared a city," more prominent by increasing its font size and making it bolder (increasing its weight).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful visual comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible change in the size or weight of the main article title "He has prepared a city." The font size appears identical, and the boldness (weight) of the characters also looks exactly the same in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction was clearly *not* applied. The title's visual properties (size and weight) remain unchanged from the "before" to the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
