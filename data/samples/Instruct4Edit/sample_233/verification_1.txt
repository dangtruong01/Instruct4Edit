Based on the images provided:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to make the logo in the top left corner slightly larger and give it more breathing room around it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. The first image displays a webpage with a logo in the top left. The second image, which is supposed to be the "after" image, is not a visual representation of the updated UI. Instead, it's an image containing text that *describes* technical changes (e.g., adjusting width/height attributes, adding padding). This does not allow for a visual comparison of the UI.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the critical missing element is the actual "after" visual state of the UI. Without it, it's impossible to visually verify if the logo was made larger or if it has more breathing room. The second image is not a visual UI screenshot but a textual explanation.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (because the "after" image does not show the UI, making visual verification impossible)
