Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the top navigation bar (the area at the very top of the page) to a slightly lighter shade of green.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to detect a discernible difference in the green color of the top navigation bar.
3. The lack of a clear visual difference makes it ambiguous whether the requested change was implemented.

Final verdict:
