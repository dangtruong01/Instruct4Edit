Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Reduce the size of the sidebar widgets' titles. The titles are in the sidebar, and we are looking for size reduction in the 'after' image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible?** It's difficult to discern any size difference. Looking at "Wort Stapel Bild Lösungen aller Level" and "Wort Stapel Bild Lösungen aller Level" (the sidebar widget titles), the change isn't readily apparent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, there's no significant and clear visual change in the sidebar widget titles' size.

**Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied**
