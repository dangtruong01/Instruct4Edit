Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Increase the horizontal spacing between the words within the answer boxes (the red boxes containing the answers).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The spaces between the words "VIDEO-PAUSE-INTERNET-KUNDEN-ARTIKEL-DIAGRAMM-ANALYSE-MEDIUM-AKTUELL-NACHRICHT-WORT-ÄRMEL" have visibly increased in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict:** ✅ Fully Applied
