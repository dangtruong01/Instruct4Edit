Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Add a subtle drop shadow to the main heading.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The text looks identical in both images, there is no visual difference.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction was to add a drop shadow to the main heading. No drop shadow is visible.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
