Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The background of the sidebar should be changed to a light gray color.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The sidebar's background color has demonstrably shifted to a light gray in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The color change is clear.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
