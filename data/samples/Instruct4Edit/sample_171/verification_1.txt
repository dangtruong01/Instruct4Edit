Here's a breakdown of my assessment:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to make the header image span the full width of the page. This means the image should be wider in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

2.  **Visibility of the Change:** Unfortunately, the images are identical. There is no change in the header image width in the "after" image.

3.  **Doubts and Ambiguities:** The instruction was to alter the width of the header image, but there is no change in the image.

**Final Verdict: ❌ Not Applied**
