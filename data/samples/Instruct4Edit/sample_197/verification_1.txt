Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the background color of the navigation links contrast more with the header.
2. In the "after" image, I cannot find any navigation links that have a background color.
3. It appears that the instruction was not applied, because there is no visible change related to navigation links or their background color.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
