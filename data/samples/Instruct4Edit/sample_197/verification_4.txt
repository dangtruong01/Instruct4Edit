Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a change in the font used for headings (h2, h3, etc.) to be more prominent. This means the font should visually stand out more compared to the body text.
2. Looking at the "after" image, the headings (like "What strain is Ghost OG," "Ghost OG strain info," etc.) do appear to be in a different, bolder font compared to the "before" image. This makes them more visually prominent.
3. There are no immediately apparent ambiguities or missing elements. All headings appear to have been updated with a more prominent font.

Final verdict:
