Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the color of social media icons to a darker shade in the footer.
2. Looking at both images, there are no social media icons present in the footer of either image. A "Follow" text appears on the right side of the second image, but it is not an icon, so the instruction is not applicable.
3. Since the icons are missing in both images, there's no way to verify if the change was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
