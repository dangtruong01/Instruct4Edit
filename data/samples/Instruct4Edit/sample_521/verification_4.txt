Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the vertical spacing between the images in the second sidebar (right-hand side).
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the images in the second sidebar appears to be visually similar in both the before and after images. It is difficult to definitively say that there has been a reduction in spacing.
3. There is ambiguity because the amount of spacing reduction is not specified, and visually the change is not clearly apparent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
