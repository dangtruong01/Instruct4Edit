Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the sidebar links to a shade of red that complements the images in the main part of the page.
2. Visually, the sidebar links appear to be the same color (black) in both the before and after images. There's no visible red shade.
3. The instruction is clear, but there's no apparent change to the sidebar link colors.

Final verdict:
