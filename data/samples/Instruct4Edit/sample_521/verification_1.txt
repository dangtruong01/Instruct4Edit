Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the navigation bar. In this case, the navigation bar is the vertical menu on the left side of the images.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible difference in the appearance of the navigation bar. There is no shadow added in the second image.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
