Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a light gray border around the "main content area". Visually, this means the area containing the dress image and the smaller images to its right.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to discern a light gray border around the specified area in the "after" image. It is possible there is a border, but it is too subtle to be confident.
3. Due to the ambiguity in discerning any border, there's a doubt about whether the instruction was correctly followed.
