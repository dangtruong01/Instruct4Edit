Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the main image (presumably the larger image in the center) larger and centered within its current space.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the main image does not appear to be significantly larger. It also does not appear to be centered more than before.
3. The change is not clearly visible, and there's no clear indication that the instruction was implemented.

Final verdict:
