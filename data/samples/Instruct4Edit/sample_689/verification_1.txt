Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to replace a generic, unbranded grey placeholder box in the website header with a specific, branded logo image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, in the "before" image, there is a prominent light grey rectangle in the top left corner of the header, which appears to be a placeholder. In the "after" image, this grey rectangle has been replaced by an image that clearly displays "Cars 65 Manuales de mecánica logo". This new image serves as a branded logo.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is very clear and direct. The placeholder is gone, and a branded image is in its place, fulfilling all aspects of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
