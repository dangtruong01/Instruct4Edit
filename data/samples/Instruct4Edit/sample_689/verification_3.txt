Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing (whitespace) both above and below the main page title, "Chevrolet Traverse LTZ 2014 Manual de mecánica", to enhance its visual prominence and make it stand out more from the surrounding content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, there is a distinct increase in the amount of whitespace above the main title (separating it from the "Manuales" link) and below the main title (separating it from the first paragraph of text). This additional breathing room effectively isolates the title, making it more prominent and easier to distinguish from the rest of the page content.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is precisely as instructed, and the increased spacing achieves the stated goal of making the title "stand out more."

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
