Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the "Descarga el Archivo" link from a simple text link into a visually prominent, rectangular button with white text. This implies changes to its background, shape, and text color to make it stand out as an actionable element.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, "Descarga el Archivo" is a standard blue, underlined text link.
    *   In the "after" image, "Descarga el Archivo" has been styled into a solid blue, rectangular shape. The text "Descarga el Archivo" within this shape is now white. This transformation makes it significantly more prominent and clearly indicates it as an interactive button.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, all aspects of the instruction appear to be fully and clearly implemented.
    *   It is prominent (achieved by the solid background and contrast).
    *   It is a rectangular button (clearly a solid, filled rectangle).
    *   The text is white (changed from blue to white).

**Final verdict:**
