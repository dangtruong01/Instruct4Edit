Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the navigation tabs, specifically "Home" and "Our Writers," more visually distinct and appear more clickable. This was to be achieved by potentially adding a softer background color and making the text within these tabs more prominent (e.g., bolder, different color, larger). The goal is to enhance their visibility and usability as interactive elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** Both "Home" and "Our Writers" are displayed as simple, unstyled black text links, appearing as bulleted list items. They lack any background color or text prominence beyond standard link styling.
    *   **After Image:**
        *   The "Our Writers" tab now clearly shows a light grey background color and its text is bolded. This makes it significantly more visually distinct and prominent compared to its previous state. It also looks more clickable, likely indicating an active or hovered state.
        *   However, the "Home" tab in the "after" image remains exactly as it was in the "before" image: plain black text without any background color or text prominence.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements. The instruction explicitly states "Make *the navigation tabs*, like 'Home' and 'Our Writers,' more visually distinct and clickable." This implies a general application of the design changes to *all* such navigation tabs. While "Our Writers" has clearly received the intended styling (likely because it's the active tab), "Home" has not. If the intent was to make *all* navigation tabs (in their default or inactive state) more distinct and clickable, then the implementation is incomplete as "Home" remains unchanged. The instruction does not specify that the changes should only apply to the active tab. Therefore, the change has only been partially applied, or applied only to a specific state (active/hovered) rather than to the general appearance of the navigation tabs as a whole.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied (or at best, partially/conditionally applied)
