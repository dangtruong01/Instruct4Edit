Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to increase the font size of section titles in the right-hand sidebar (which includes the area below the main content where these titles reside), specifically mentioning "Lottomania" and "Blog Archive," to make them more noticeable.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, "Lottomania," "Tweets by @MyLottoInfo," and "Blog Archive" are all rendered in a small, standard font size, blending in with the surrounding text.
    *   In the "after" image, all three of these titles ("Lottomania," "Tweets by @MyLottoInfo," and "Blog Archive") have been significantly enlarged and appear to be bolded, making them stand out much more prominently as distinct section headings.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction was not only applied to the specifically mentioned titles but also to another similar section title ("Tweets by @MyLottoInfo"), demonstrating a thorough understanding and application of the requested change. The titles are both "larger" and "more noticeable" as instructed.

Final verdict:
