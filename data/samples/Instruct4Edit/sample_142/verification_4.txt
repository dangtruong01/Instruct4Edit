Okay, I will meticulously compare the two images based on your instructions.

---

**Instruction:** The shaded box at the very bottom of each blog post, containing information like the author and share buttons, looks dated. Remove its background shading and make its text slightly larger for better readability.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The instruction targets a specific box at the bottom of the blog post, which currently has a background shade and contains author and share information.
    *   The first intended change is to remove the background shading from this box.
    *   The second intended change is to increase the font size of the text within this box to improve readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Removal of background shading:** Yes, in the "before" image, the box containing "Posted by Unknown..." and "Email ThisBlogThis!..." has a distinct light grey background. In the "after" image, this background shading has been completely removed, and the area is now white, blending with the main content background. This change is clearly visible and fully implemented.
    *   **Make its text slightly larger:** No, upon careful comparison, the text within this box ("Posted by Unknown...", "Email ThisBlogThis!Share to TwitterShare to FacebookShare to Pinterest") appears to be the exact same size in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in font size for better readability.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There is no doubt regarding the removal of the background shading; it has been successfully removed.
    *   However, the instruction to make the text "slightly larger" has not been implemented at all. The text size remains unchanged from the "before" to the "after" state. This constitutes a missing element in the implementation of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
