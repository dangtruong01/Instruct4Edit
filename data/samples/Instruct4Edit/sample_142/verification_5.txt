Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The core instruction is to increase the horizontal space occupied by the "main content area" of the page. This means the primary text, images, and other relevant content should spread out more to the left and right, utilizing more of the browser's available width, especially on wider screens. The goal is to move away from a fixed, narrow column layout.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is very clearly visible.
    In the "before" image, the article text (starting with "No Jackpot After all for German Lottery Player") is contained within a relatively narrow column, leaving a significant amount of white space on the right side of the page.
    In the "after" image, the article text block has significantly expanded horizontally to the right. The right margin of the text is much closer to the edge of the visible page area, indicating that the content area has indeed stretched to fill more of the available width. The social sharing buttons and the "The One-Stop-Shop" advertisement below the article have also expanded their width to match the new content area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The primary goal of widening the "main content area" (the article body) has been successfully achieved.
    One minor observation is that the "The Leading Lottery Program" advertisement that was present below the first ad in the "before" image is entirely missing in the "after" image. While this is a visual change, it does not negate the fact that the *main content area* (the article text) *did* stretch as instructed. The instruction focused on making the *area* wider, not on the retention of every single element, though a reviewer might flag the disappearance of content as something to be aware of if it wasn't an intended part of the design change. However, based solely on the instruction provided, the stretching of the main content is evident.

Final verdict:
