Here is the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to soften the appearance of the "vBulletin Message" box. This was to be achieved by performing two actions:
    *   Removing the existing "harsh blue border" around the box.
    *   *Replacing* that border with a "subtle shadow effect."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Removal of harsh blue border:** Yes, the distinct blue border around the "vBulletin Message" box, which is present in the "before" image, is clearly absent in the "after" image. This part of the instruction has been implemented.
    *   **Addition of subtle shadow effect:** No, there is no discernible subtle shadow effect applied around the "vBulletin Message" box in the "after" image. The edges of the box appear sharp and blend directly into the background without any visible depth or shadow.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a missing element. While the "harsh blue border" was successfully removed, the crucial second part of the instruction – to *replace* it with a "subtle shadow effect" – has not been implemented. The box is now borderless, but it does not have the specified shadow, which was intended as the softening replacement. The instruction was not fully executed as it required a replacement effect, not just a removal.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
