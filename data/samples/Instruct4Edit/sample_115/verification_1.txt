**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to make the "12 O'Clock High!" logo, located at the very top of the page, larger in size and horizontally centered. The ultimate goal is to increase its prominence.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Size Increase:** Yes, the logo in the "after" image is significantly larger in both height and width compared to the "before" image. It takes up a much more substantial portion of the header area.
    *   **Horizontal Centering:** Yes, in the "before" image, the logo is aligned to the left. In the "after" image, the logo has been repositioned and is clearly centered horizontally on the page.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both components of the instruction – increasing the size of the logo and centering it horizontally – have been fully and unambiguously applied. The changes are very clear and directly achieve the stated goal of making the logo more prominent.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
