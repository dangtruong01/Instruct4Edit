**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modify the visual appearance of all buttons on the page by rounding their sharp, 90-degree corners. This change is intended to give the UI a softer and more modern aesthetic.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. After a meticulous comparison of the "before" and "after" images, no elements that can be identified as buttons (e.g., the small, empty input fields that likely function as submit buttons in the top right login area and within the "vBulletin Message" login form) show any signs of rounded corners. All such elements, along with other interactive inputs (text fields, dropdowns), retain their original sharp, square corners. The two images appear visually identical in terms of corner styling for all elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the absence of the intended change. The instruction was to "Round the corners of all buttons." Visually, no button-like elements or even input fields (which are sometimes styled as buttons) have had their corners rounded in the "after" image. The modification simply was not implemented.
