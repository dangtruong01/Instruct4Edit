Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to lighten the gray background color behind the "ABOUT MONEY MORNING" heading in the footer.
2. Comparing the before and after images, it is very hard to see a difference in the gray color behind the "ABOUT MONEY MORNING" heading. There might be a slight change, but it is not definitive.
3. Due to the lack of certainty and the small difference (if any), it is not possible to confirm that the change was fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
