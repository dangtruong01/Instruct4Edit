Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to remove the border line immediately below the main navigation menu. Considering the provided images, the "main navigation menu" is ambiguous. Based on common UI conventions, the most probable target is the area near the search bar at the very top. Let's assume the instruction refers to a thin horizontal border located under this potential menu.
2. By comparing the before and after images, there is no discernible difference. The potential border still appears to be present.
3. Although the exact location of the navigation menu is ambiguous, the existence of a border remains. Therefore, the instruction was not fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
