Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to add a subtle border around the featured image, which is the image in the center of the page.
2. Upon close inspection, I do not see any border added to the featured image in the "after" image.
3. There is no visible change and the instruction was not followed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
