Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the size of the site title in the header.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the site title "vielleserin" in the header appears larger in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
