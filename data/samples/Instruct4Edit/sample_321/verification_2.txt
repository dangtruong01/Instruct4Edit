Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to significantly increase the size and contrast of the "Download Full Movie Here" links found beneath each video thumbnail, with the goal of making them much easier to spot.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** The "Download Full Movie Here" text links are present as small, dark text on a white background. Their size is minimal, and their contrast is low, making them quite difficult to spot, especially in a quick scan.
*   **After Image:** These links have been transformed into prominent buttons. They are significantly larger in size compared to the original text links. Their color scheme (white text on a dark green background) provides a very high contrast, making them stand out dramatically against the white page background. Each button is clearly positioned beneath its corresponding video thumbnail.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The change is exceptionally clear and directly addresses all aspects of the instruction. The size has been "significantly increased" by converting them into full-fledged buttons. The contrast has been "significantly increased" by using a high-contrast color palette (white text on dark green). As a result, they are indeed "much easier to spot."

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
