Here's my cautious visual UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requires transforming the plain text phrases "JOIN NOW FOR INSTANT DOWNLOAD ACCESS!" into distinct visual buttons. These buttons should have a solid background and slightly rounded corners, making them clearly appear clickable.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The phrases "JOIN NOW FOR INSTANT DOWNLOAD ACCESS!" appear as bold, red text. They are not enclosed in any shape, nor do they have a background, and they do not visually resemble buttons.
    *   **After Image:** Both instances of the phrase "JOIN NOW FOR INSTANT DOWNLOAD ACCESS!" have been redesigned. They are now encased within solid dark grey (almost black) rectangular shapes. The text color has changed from red to white, providing strong contrast against the dark background. The corners of these new shapes are visibly rounded, not sharp. The overall appearance strongly conveys a clickable button element.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **"Clear, clickable buttons":** Visually, they are significantly clearer and possess the common attributes of clickable buttons (distinct shape, background, text contrast).
    *   **"Solid background":** Yes, they both have a solid dark background.
    *   **"Slightly rounded corners":** Yes, the corners are visibly rounded on both elements. The degree of rounding appears to fit the description "slightly".
    *   The instruction refers to "phrases" (plural), and both instances of the specified phrase have been redesigned in the "after" image.
    *   Given the constraint to only consider "VISUAL changes", the transformation from plain text to distinct button-like elements with the specified attributes is fully evident.

**Final verdict:**
