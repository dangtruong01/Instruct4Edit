*   **1. What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to transform the 'Log In' button (labeled 'Войти') from its current dark and stark appearance into a softer, more integrated element within the main navigation. Suggested methods included using a lighter brand color for the fill or adding a subtle outline.

*   **2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    -   **Before:** The 'Войти' button is a solid dark grey/black rectangle with white text.
    -   **After:** The 'Войти' button is now a white rectangle with a subtle yellow outline and yellow text.

*   **3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The core objective of making the button "softer" and "more integrated" has been achieved. The button no longer appears "dark and stark." One of the suggested methods, "a subtle outline," has been directly implemented using a brand-consistent yellow color, which also contributes to the "softer, more integrated look."

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
