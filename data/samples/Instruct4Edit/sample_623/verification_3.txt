**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to enhance the visual prominence and vibrancy of the main action buttons (specifically 'Log In by SMS' / 'ПО НОМЕРУ ТЕЛЕФОНА' and 'ЧЕРЕЗ MOBILE ID') in the login pop-up. This implied a change from a "somewhat faded" state to one with "full, vibrant color and clear visual prominence."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon a detailed side-by-side comparison, there is no discernible visual difference in the color, saturation, brightness, or overall vibrancy of either the yellow "ПО НОМЕРУ ТЕЛЕФОНА" button or the purple "ЧЕРЕЗ MOBILE ID" button between the "before" and "after" images. Both buttons appear identically prominent and vibrant in both states. The initial premise that the buttons "currently appear somewhat faded" does not seem to be visually supported by the "before" image, and consequently, no visual change was applied to address this perceived issue.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes. There is no visual evidence that any change was made to the buttons' color or prominence. The images are effectively identical with respect to the specified elements. If the instruction was meant to trigger a visual modification to address a "faded" appearance, this modification was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
