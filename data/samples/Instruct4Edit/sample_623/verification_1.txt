Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to make the 'Download App' button (the yellow button in the top right corner with the text "Скачать приложение") more eye-catching. This was to be achieved either by making its yellow shade brighter or by giving it a more prominent visual treatment (e.g., a change in size, a new border, shadow, etc.).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, the intended change is not visible. Upon careful comparison of the 'Download App' button in both the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible difference in its appearance. The yellow shade, size, and overall visual treatment of the button remain identical.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the comparison; the button's appearance is unchanged. The instruction was clear, but the visual change requested was not applied at all.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
