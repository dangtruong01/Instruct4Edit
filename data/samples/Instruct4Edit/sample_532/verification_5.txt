Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to use a lighter shade of the current background color for the header. I would expect the header area which includes the logo and navigation on the right to appear in a lighter shade of white.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible difference in the background color of the header area. Both images appear to have the same white background.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction, but the requested change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
