Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the "main title" font to a bolder weight. The two potential main titles in the image are "Etiqueta: chocolate negro fundir" and "Tarta De Cuajada Con Chocolate".
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernible difference in the font weight of either of these titles. They appear to be using the same font weight in both images.
3. There is no visible change in the font weight.

Final verdict:
