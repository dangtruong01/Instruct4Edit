Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to modify "recipe cards" to have a softer, rounded look. Recipe cards would be a card containing information and a picture of a recipe.
2. There are no recipe cards visible in the image. The image shows a photograph of a dessert and some text below.
3. There is nothing that could have rounded edges or softer look.

Final verdict:
