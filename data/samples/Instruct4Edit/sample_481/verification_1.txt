Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires increasing the spacing between the navigation menu items. The navigation menu is located at the top left of the page, below the "Toggle navigation" button.
2. Upon comparison, the spacing between the items "DOMŮ", "SPORTKA", "ŠŤASTNÝCH 10", and "EUROJACKPOT" does not appear to have changed. The spacing is the same in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, and the location of the navigation menu is clear. However, the instruction has not been implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
