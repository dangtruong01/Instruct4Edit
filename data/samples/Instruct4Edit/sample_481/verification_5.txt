Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the color of the "Přidat komentář" button to be brighter and more engaging. This implies a visual change to the button's appearance.
2. Comparing the two images, the color of the "Přidat komentář" button appears to be the same shade of grey in both the before and after images. There is no noticeable difference in brightness or color.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, however, the visual change has not been applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
