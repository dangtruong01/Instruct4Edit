Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle border around the sidebar. It is necessary to identify the sidebar first. Looking at both images, the sidebar seems to be the area on the left side of the main content.
2. Comparing the two images, it's not possible to see any visible border around the sidebar in the second image.
3. There is no visible change that matches the instruction.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
