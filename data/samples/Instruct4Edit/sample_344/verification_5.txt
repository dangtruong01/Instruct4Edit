Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the footer stick to the bottom of the page. This means that even if the content is short, the footer should still be at the very bottom of the viewport.
2. By comparing the before and after images, we can see that the footer is positioned at the same place. It does not seem to be sticking to the bottom of the page regardless of the content's length.
3. There is no visual change suggesting the instruction has been implemented.

Final verdict:
