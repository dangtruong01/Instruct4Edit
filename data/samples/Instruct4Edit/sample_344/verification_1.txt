Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the visual connection of the search bar and the search button to make them appear as a single element. This means reducing or eliminating the space between the two.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the space between the search bar and the (implied) button area has not been reduced.
3. There is a clear gap between the search bar and what would be the search button area.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
