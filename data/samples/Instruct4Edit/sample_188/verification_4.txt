Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to make the heading "NEW MEMBERS:" bolder.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The "NEW MEMBERS:" heading in the "after" image appears bolder than in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clearly visible and unambiguous.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
