Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction asks for increased space between the article title ("Technology Changing Education"), the author (Raja Vikram), and the category information (Category: Education...).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the space between those elements doesn't seem visibly changed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the space between the title, author, and category is very similar in both images, thus, the instruction does not appear to be applied.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
