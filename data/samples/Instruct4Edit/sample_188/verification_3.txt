Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Change the entire page's background color to light gray.
2.  **Is this change visible?** No, there is no change in the background color, which remains white.
3.  **Are there any doubts or missing elements?** The instruction to change the background color is straightforward, but the after image does not reflect this change.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
