Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The main navigation links, currently displayed as a table, should be transformed into a horizontal row.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the navigation links (HOME, WANT AN ACCOUNT?, SUBMIT ARTICLES, TOP AUTHORS, Commercial Collection Agency) are arranged horizontally.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is clearly visible.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
