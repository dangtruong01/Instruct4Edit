Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the font of the text in the tables to a sans-serif font, aiming for improved readability.
2. Comparing the images, the font used in the tables appears to have been changed. The original image seems to use a font with serifs (small decorative strokes), while the modified image uses a font without these serifs.
3. There are no immediately obvious doubts or missing elements. The font change seems to have been applied consistently across all text within the tables.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
