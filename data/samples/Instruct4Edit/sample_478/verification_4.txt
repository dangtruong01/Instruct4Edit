Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header. This would visually make the header appear as though it's slightly raised above the content beneath it.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible difference in the header area. There's no discernible shadow effect added in the "after" image.
3. There is no visual evidence to confirm that a shadow effect was added to the header.

Final verdict:
