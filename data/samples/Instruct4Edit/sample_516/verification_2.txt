Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the blog post titles and their content. This means the vertical space separating the title of each blog post from the text/image directly below it should be visibly larger in the "after" image.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to determine if the spacing between the titles and the content has changed. The difference is subtle and almost negligible.
3. The change is not clearly visible.

Final verdict:
