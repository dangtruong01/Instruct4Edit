Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires changing the font of the post excerpts to a serif font. Serif fonts have small decorative strokes (serifs) at the end of each letter, while sans-serif fonts do not.
2. Looking at the "before" image, the post excerpts appear to be in a sans-serif font. In the "after" image, it is very difficult to tell whether the font has changed to a serif font as the screenshots provided do not provide a high enough resolution to definitively say.
3. The images do not have enough clarity to determine whether the instruction has been applied or not.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
