Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to lighten and soften the blue background to a pastel shade. This means the blue should become lighter and less saturated, appearing more gentle.
2. Visually, the blue background in the "after" image is significantly lighter and less intense than the "before" image. It now appears more pastel-like.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The entire blue background seems to have been affected as instructed.

Final verdict:
