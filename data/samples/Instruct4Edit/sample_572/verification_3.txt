Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the accordion headers. Accordion headers refer to the text sections that expand and collapse, such as "What does a Professional Organizer do?"
2. Comparing the before and after images, I cannot discern any visible shadow added to the accordion headers in the after image. The text and overall appearance of these sections appear identical in both images.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction itself. However, the expected visual change is not present in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
