Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the submenu text darker for better readability. The submenu text is located in the left sidebar under the "Welcome", "What I Do", "My Organizing Blog", "Learn Resources", and "FAQs" sections.
2. Comparing the two images, the text in the after image appears to be negligibly darker than the before image. It is very subtle and difficult to detect with certainty.
3. The change is so minimal that I'm not 100% sure that it has been effectively applied. There might be a slight color difference, but it's not significant enough to definitively say it was successfully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
