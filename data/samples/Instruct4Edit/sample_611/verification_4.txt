Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect under the main content area. This implies a shadow should be visible along the edges of the central white section of the page, suggesting that it is slightly elevated above the background.
2. I cannot see any discernable shadow effect on the "after" image. There is no change to the border of the main white content area that would suggest a shadow has been added.
3. The instruction is straightforward. The lack of any visible shadow effect means the change was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
