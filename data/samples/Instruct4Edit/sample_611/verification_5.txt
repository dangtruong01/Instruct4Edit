Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the font of the footer links to a more readable sans-serif font. This means the text in the light blue footer section should change from a serif font (with serifs, like Times New Roman) to a sans-serif font (without serifs, like Arial or Helvetica).
2. Comparing the two images, the footer text in the "after" image appears to be using a sans-serif font, while the "before" image seems to be using a serif font. The change is visible and consistent with the instruction.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
