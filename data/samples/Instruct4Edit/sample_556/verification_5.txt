Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to align the "Stay connected..." text in the footer with the social media icons below it. This implies horizontally aligning the left edge of the text with the left edge of the social media icons.
2. Looking at the before and after images, I cannot see any change in the position of the "Stay connected..." text. The position relative to the social media icons (which also appear to be in the same place) remains unchanged.
3. There is no visible change.

Final verdict:
