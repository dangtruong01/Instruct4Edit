Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the "Download App", "About", "Search", and "Signup" links in the navigation bar to be visually distinct, either with a subtle background color or a border on hover.
2. I see no visible changes to the appearance of these links in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. There's no background color added, and it is impossible to confirm if hover effects are implemented via static images.
3. There's no visual evidence that the instruction was followed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
