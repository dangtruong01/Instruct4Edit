Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the size of the main navigation menu items to prevent wrapping on smaller screens. This implies a reduction in font size or some other size-reducing technique.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the main navigation menu items (HOME, ABOUT, CONTACT US) at the top appear to be the same size. There's no visually discernible difference in their size.
3. There are no apparent changes to the menu items' size.

Final verdict:
