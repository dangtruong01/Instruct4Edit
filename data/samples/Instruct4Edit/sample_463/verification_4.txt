Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color of the sidebar headings (e.g., "Recent Forum Discussions," "Facebook," "Tour Crystal Lake!," "Friday the 13th Props Book"). It should be a slightly darker color than the current one to improve contrast.
2. Comparing the two images, the background color of the sidebar headings looks visually unchanged.
3. I see no visual differences in the background color of the sidebar headings.

Final verdict:
