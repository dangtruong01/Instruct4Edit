Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to center the date and author information below the main article content.
2. In the "after" image, the date "November 9, 2023" which is assumed to be part of the date and author information, remains left-aligned, and is not centered.
3. This is the only visible element below the main article. It should be visually checked if the entire date and author information section exists and is centered below the article.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
