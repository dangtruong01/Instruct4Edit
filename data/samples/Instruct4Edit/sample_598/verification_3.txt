Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires adding a subtle shadow effect to the main navigation menu items (Tutorials, Freelers, Collection, About, Contact).
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any visual difference, specifically the addition of a subtle shadow, to the navigation menu items in the after image compared to the before image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visually apparent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
