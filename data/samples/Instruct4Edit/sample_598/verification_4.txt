Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing between the blog post title ("Using Symbols Panel in Adobe Illustrator") and the category ("TUTORIALS") which is located directly above the title.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible change in the vertical spacing between the blog post title and the category.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction was not applied.
