Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to give the search input field in the sidebar rounded corners.
2. Comparing the two images, the search input field in the sidebar has the same squared corners in both the before and after images.
3. The change is not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
