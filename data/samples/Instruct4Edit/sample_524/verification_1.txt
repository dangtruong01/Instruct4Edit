Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the navigation bar. Looking at the images, the navigation bar seems to be represented by the elements: "Home", "All Articles", "By Subject", "E-Books". These elements are presented on a white background at the top of the page. Therefore, the shadow should be added to this top area to make it stand out more.
2. Comparing both images, I cannot perceive any visual difference related to a shadow in the navigation bar or the top part of the page.
3. There are no apparent shadow effects applied to the top navigation area in the 'after' image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
