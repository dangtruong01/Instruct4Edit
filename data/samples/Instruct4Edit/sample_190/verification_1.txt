Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to soften the corners of the logo image. The logo image refers to the image of the U.S. Marine LCpl Alejandro Macias.
2. Comparing the two images, the corners of the logo image are the same. No visible softening has been applied.
3. There are no ambiguities. The instruction is clear, but no changes are visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
