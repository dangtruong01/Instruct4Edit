Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle horizontal line to be added between each item in the "Exchange News" sidebar list.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there are no visible horizontal lines separating the items in the "Exchange News" list in the "after" image.
3. There are no visual separators as requested.

Final verdict:
