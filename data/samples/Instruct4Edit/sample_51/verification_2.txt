Step-by-step justification:
1. What is the intended visual change?
The instruction aims to increase the horizontal space (margin or padding) between the blog post image and the text that appears next to it.

2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?
I am unable to determine if the space increased, as the instruction does not specifically identify which blog post this applies to. It is unclear what text the instruction is referring to.

3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?
The instruction lacks clarity and the area of change is not identified.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
