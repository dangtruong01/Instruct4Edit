Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction wants the blue background to be changed to light gray.
2.  **Is the change visible?:** The original image has a light blue background and the modified image's background remains light blue.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?:** The background color did not change, therefore, this is not applied.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
