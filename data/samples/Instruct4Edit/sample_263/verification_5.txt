Step-by-step justification:
1. What is the intended visual change? Round the corners of the page number buttons at the bottom of the content area.
2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image? No.
3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements? The "after" image is identical to the "before" image. The corner of the page number buttons have not been rounded.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
