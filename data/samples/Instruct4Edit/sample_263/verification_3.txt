Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction is to make the column headings more prominent, which can be achieved by increasing font size or using a bolder font weight.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. There is no discernible change in the column headings. The text in the column headings ("1", "2", "3", and the date) appears identical in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the requested visual change is not visible in the second image.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
