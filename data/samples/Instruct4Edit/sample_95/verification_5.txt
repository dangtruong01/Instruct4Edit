Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the text "#GreatAkokites" in the top-left corner more prominent. This was suggested to be achieved by using a bolder font or a slight increase in font size, or any other method that makes it "stand out more."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the text "#GreatAkokites" in the top-left corner appears to be identical in both instances. There is no discernible change in font weight, size, color, or any other visual attribute that would make it stand out more. It retains the same appearance in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the intended visual change is entirely absent. The element remains exactly as it was in the "before" image, indicating that the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
