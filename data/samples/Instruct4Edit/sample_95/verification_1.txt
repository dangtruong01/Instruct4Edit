Here's my cautious visual UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that "All rectangular buttons on the page, especially the prominent 'Give Now' button, should have softly rounded corners." This means that any button with sharp, 90-degree corners in the "before" image should appear with a subtle curve or radius at its corners in the "after" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible.
    *   **Prominent "Give Now" button:** Upon close inspection of the "Give Now" button located in the upper-left section of the page (below the navigation links), its corners remain sharp and angular in the "after" image, identical to their appearance in the "before" image. There is no discernible rounding applied.
    *   **Other rectangular buttons:** Similarly, the "Give Now" button located at the very bottom-left of the page also retains its sharp, unrounded corners in the "after" image. There are no other elements that clearly function as rectangular buttons on the page that would apply to this instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the implementation. The instruction was clear about rounding the corners. Visually, the corners of the specified buttons (and all other potential rectangular buttons) have not changed at all; they remain unrounded in the "after" image. The instructed design change has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
