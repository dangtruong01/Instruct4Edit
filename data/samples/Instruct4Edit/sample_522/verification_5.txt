Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the video sections. This should make the page appear less cluttered by adding more white space.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to perceive any noticeable difference in spacing between the video sections.
3. Due to the lack of any apparent increase in spacing, it cannot be definitively determined if the instruction was correctly implemented.

Final verdict:
