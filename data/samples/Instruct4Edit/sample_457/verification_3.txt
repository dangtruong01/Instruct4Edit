Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the two main sections on the page. Without further context, it is difficult to determine which sections are to be separated. It is assumed that the sections are the large textual blocks on the page.
2. Upon comparing the two images, it is difficult to identify any significant visual changes in spacing between the text blocks.
3. The ambiguous nature of the instruction and the lack of clear visual changes lead to uncertainty.

Final verdict:
