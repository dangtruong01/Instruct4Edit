Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to apply a subtle gradient effect to the horizontal lines present in the image. This means the lines should no longer be a single, solid color, but instead transition between two or more similar colors.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the horizontal lines appear to be the same solid color in both. There is no visible gradient effect.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction itself. The change is simply not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
