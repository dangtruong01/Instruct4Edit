Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation links in the header uppercase.
2. Visually comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, the navigation links in the header (HOME, TESTIMONIALS, DONORS, NEWSLETTER) are already in uppercase in both images. Therefore, no change has been made.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction has not resulted in a visible change.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
