Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to increase the horizontal dimension (width) of the primary content container (the large, light-purple box that holds the "vBulletin Message," explanatory text, and login form). This expansion should result in the content area taking up more of the total screen width, consequently reducing the empty space (margins) on its left and/or right sides.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon meticulous visual comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible difference in the width of the main content area (the light-purple box). The left and right margins surrounding this content box appear to be identical in both images, indicating that its width has not been altered to fill more of the available screen space. The content area retains its original dimensions and position.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the interpretation of the instruction or the identification of the "main content area." The visual evidence is clear: the requested change was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
