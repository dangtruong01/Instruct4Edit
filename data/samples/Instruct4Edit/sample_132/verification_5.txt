Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies changing the *entire page's background color* to a shade that is both *darker* and *more muted* than the original. This implies a clear, noticeable shift in the outermost background color of the UI.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close visual inspection of both the "before" and "after" images, the background color of the entire page (the area outside the main content box and header elements) appears to be exactly the same light blue-grey in both versions. There is no perceptible change in lightness (it's not darker) or saturation (it's not more muted).
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction appears to be completely unapplied. The specific visual change requested (darkening and muting the entire page background) is entirely absent in the "after" image. The background color remains identical to the "before" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
