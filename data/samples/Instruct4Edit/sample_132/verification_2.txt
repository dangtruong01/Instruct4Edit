Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction mandates that all interactive buttons, with specific emphasis on login and register buttons, should have their sharp, square corners transformed into softer, rounded corners. This means we should observe a visible curvature at the button edges in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the two images, I have visually inspected all interactive button elements:
    *   The "Register" button/tab at the top left corner.
    *   The smaller button-like inputs next to the "User Name" and "Password" fields in the top right section.
    *   The smaller button-like inputs next to the "User Name" and "Password" fields within the main "vBulletin Message" section (under "Log In").
    *   The "Forum Jump" button at the bottom left.

    In both the "before" and "after" images, the corners of all these elements appear to be identically sharp and square. There is no discernible difference in the corner radii of any button between the original and modified images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no ambiguity. The intended change of rounding corners is completely absent from all interactive buttons in the "after" image. The "after" image appears to be visually identical to the "before" image in terms of button corner styling. The instruction was not implemented.
