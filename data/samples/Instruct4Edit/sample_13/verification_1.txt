Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction is to change the color of the navigation menu items to a lighter color.
2.  **Change visibility:** While the navigation menu items in the "After" image are subtly lighter, it's difficult to tell for certain due to the similarity of the original colors.
3.  **Doubts and ambiguities:** There is a very subtle visual change that could be a lighter color.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
