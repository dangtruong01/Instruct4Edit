Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** Add a subtle shadow to the image captions. This implies a slight offset and blurring of the text to create a sense of depth.
2.  **Is the change visible?** No. There are no visible shadows added to the image captions.
3.  **Any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The requested change is not visible.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
