Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Increase the font size of the main article heading "Season 1, Episode 11 — "Shrinkage — pt. 2"".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the font size appears to be larger in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict:** ✅ Fully Applied
