Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to increase the space between the main article content and the comments section.
2. It is difficult to discern a clear and significant increase in spacing between the article content and the comments section. The area of interest starts near the bottom of the images, just above the "Listen to the 2nd podcast online" section. Both images appear almost identical in this region.
3. There is no apparent increase in spacing visible.

Final verdict:
