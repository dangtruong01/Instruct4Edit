Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the plain text links "Previous Post" and "Next Post" into visually distinct elements that clearly signal their clickable nature, making them look more like interactive buttons rather than just hyperlinked text. This implies adding a background, possibly borders, and changing text styling to enhance their prominence and perceived functionality.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible and effective.
    *   In the "before" image, both "← Previous Post" and "Next Post →" are standard blue, underlined text links, blending in with other textual elements.
    *   In the "after" image, both "← Previous Post" and "Next Post →" are now enclosed within distinct, rectangular shapes with rounded corners, a reddish-orange background, and white text. They have a clear padding around the text and stand out significantly. The "Next Post" button has also been right-aligned, further emphasizing its distinct role as a navigation button.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The transformation from simple text links to distinct, button-like elements is fully and clearly achieved. The choice of a contrasting background color, text color, internal padding, and a defined shape undeniably makes them look like clickable buttons, fulfilling the "enhance visual appearance" and "look more like distinct, clickable buttons" requirements.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
