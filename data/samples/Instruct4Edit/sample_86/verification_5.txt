Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Increase the size of the website's logo in the top left corner.
    *   Ensure the logo aligns better vertically with the main navigation menu items ("Main Menu", "Fact Checks").

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Logo size:** In the "after" image, the "TruthOrFiction?" logo is noticeably larger than in the "before" image. Its width and height have both increased, making it more prominent.
    *   **Vertical alignment:** In the "before" image, the logo appears somewhat small and positioned high relative to the "Main Menu" and "Fact Checks" buttons. In the "after" image, the larger logo has been repositioned downwards, so its overall height now spans across the vertical space occupied by both "Main Menu" and "Fact Checks", creating a much better visual balance and vertical alignment with the primary navigation elements. The top of the logo aligns well with the top of the "Main Menu" button, and the bottom of the logo aligns well with the bottom of the "Fact Checks" button.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   No, both parts of the instruction (size increase and improved vertical alignment) are clearly and visibly implemented in the "after" image. The change is distinct and unambiguous.
