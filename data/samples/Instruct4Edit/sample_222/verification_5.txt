**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims for two primary changes in the very bottom section (the footer text):
    *   **Increased font size:** Make the text visually larger.
    *   **Increased spacing/breathing room:** Add more space around the text (padding, margin, line-height) to make it feel less cramped and easier to read.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Text size:** Yes, the text in the footer section ("LodiBet - the best online games...", "Copyright © LodiBet...") is visibly larger in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Breathing room:** Yes, there is noticeably more space around the text in the "after" image:
        *   The left padding has increased, moving the text further from the left edge.
        *   The line-height (vertical space between lines) appears to have increased, making the two lines of text less cramped vertically.
        *   There is more vertical space below the last line of text, pushing it up slightly from the very bottom edge of the screen.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both parts of the instruction ("larger" and "more breathing room around it") have been clearly and effectively implemented. The changes contribute directly to improved readability and a less cramped appearance for the footer text.
