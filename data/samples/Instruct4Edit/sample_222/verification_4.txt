Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies increasing the vertical space *between* each individual quote block. This means the blank lines or margins separating distinct paragraphs of text should be enlarged, aiming to make the content feel less crowded and easier to visually process.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is a clear, albeit subtle, increase in the vertical spacing between the text blocks (paragraphs). For instance, the gap between the first and second paragraph, and subsequent paragraphs, is visibly wider in the "after" image. This makes the individual blocks stand out more distinctly.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No doubts or ambiguities. The change requested was "increase the amount of vertical space separating each individual quote block," and this has been implemented clearly and consistently throughout the main content area. The intent of making the content feel less dense and easier to scan is also supported by this visual change.

**Final verdict:**
