Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The "LOGIN" and "SIGN UP" buttons should have soft, rounded edges.
    *   Their colors should be harmonious.
    *   The "SIGN UP" button's color should be more prominent and distinct from the "LOGIN" button's color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Rounded edges:** No. Both the "LOGIN" and "SIGN UP" buttons retain their sharp, square corners in the "after" image, identical to the "before" image. There are no visible rounded edges on either button.
    *   **Harmonious colors/Prominent SIGN UP color:** No. The colors of both buttons ("LOGIN" is dark grey, "SIGN UP" is yellow) are exactly the same in the "after" image as they are in the "before" image. There has been no change to achieve harmony or alter prominence.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There are no doubts; the buttons in both images are visually identical in terms of shape and color. All aspects of the instruction appear to be completely unaddressed.
