**Step-by-step justification:**
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the main title. However, the images do not show the title, which makes it impossible to evaluate if the change was applied.

3. The title is missing from both images, making it impossible to compare and confirm the change.

**Final verdict:**
