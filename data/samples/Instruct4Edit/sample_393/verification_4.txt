Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to visually separate the footer from the main content using either a background color or a subtle border.
2. Comparing the two images, it is hard to discern any visual separation between the footer ("Fox Studio" and "WordPress gururla sunar") and the main content in both images.
3. There is no visible background color or border added to the footer in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
