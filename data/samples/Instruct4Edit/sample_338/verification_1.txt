Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the font size of the "Mommy Expressions" site title and make it stand out more prominently at the very top of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The "Mommy Expressions" title is present at the top-left. Its font size is relatively small, similar in visual weight and size to other text elements like the article title directly below it.
    *   **After Image:** The "Mommy Expressions" title is significantly larger in font size. It also appears to be bolder, making it much more visually dominant and distinct from the other text on the page. The change is very clear and immediately noticeable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The title is unequivocally "larger" and "more prominent" in the after image. The instruction has been fully and clearly implemented.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
