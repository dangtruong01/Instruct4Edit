Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for the image embedded within the article content to be horizontally centered. In both images, there is one small image located near the bottom of the article, just before the "Today's topic..." line. The intent is for this specific image to move from its current left-aligned position to the horizontal center of the article's text column.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the image's horizontal position remains exactly the same. It is still left-aligned within the article content area in the "after" image, just as it was in the "before" image. It has not been centered.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The image's position has clearly not changed, and it is visibly not centered.

**Final verdict:**
