Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the vertical space between the main site header (the area containing "Mommy Expressions" and the top-right icons) and the article's headline ("The pregnant female teacher suddenly "fainted" ..."). This would mean the article headline should appear further down the page in the "after" image compared to the "before" image, creating more empty space above it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the change is not visible. Upon careful comparison, the vertical position of the article's headline relative to the top of the page and the main site header appears identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in the vertical space between these two elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts. The instruction specifies an increase in vertical space, which would visually push the headline downwards. This visual effect is entirely absent. The layout of the main header and the headline is precisely the same in both images.
