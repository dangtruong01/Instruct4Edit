Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to add a light background color specifically to the section containing the post date and author information (e.g., "Posted 2023年10月29日 in GrowingUpGems Blog", "Admin"). The purpose is to create a clear visual separation for this metadata section from the main article content above and any subsequent footer elements below.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the area containing the post date, author, tags, and "Proudly powered by Wordpres" is on the same pure white background as the rest of the page. In the "after" image, this entire horizontal band, which includes the post date and author information on the left and the tags/powered by information on the right, now has a distinct, very light grey background color. This subtle color change visually sets this section apart.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The background color is applied to the intended section. The color is "light" as specified, and it successfully creates a visual separation, making this information block stand out from its surroundings.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
