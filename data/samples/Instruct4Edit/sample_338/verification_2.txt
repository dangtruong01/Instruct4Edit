Here's the comparison and justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to reduce the horizontal space that the main article text occupies. This means increasing the left and/or right padding/margins around the text content, making the lines of text shorter.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** The main article text spans a wide portion of the page, with relatively narrow left and right margins.
*   **After Image:** The main article text block is noticeably narrower. Both the left and right margins/padding have been increased, resulting in shorter lines of text. This change is clearly visible.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, the visual change directly corresponding to "narrow the width of the main article text area" is evident and unambiguous. The text block has indeed been narrowed.

**Final verdict:**
