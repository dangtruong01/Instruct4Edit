Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests a subtle shadow be added to the header to make it stand out from the background image when the user scrolls.
2. Comparing the two images, there's no visible change in the header. It looks the same in both images, with no added shadow effect.
3. There's no ambiguity in the instruction itself. However, the change is not visually evident in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
