Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a darker overlay on the header background image to improve the readability of the menu text.
2. Comparing the two images, it is hard to see a significant difference in the darkness of the overlay. While there *might* be a slight darkening, it's subtle. The large smiley face in the second image obstructs a clear comparison of the relevant background area, so I cannot be certain.
3. The key area for evaluation (behind the menu text) is obscured in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
