Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a border around the main content area. This means the white area where the main text, image, and title are located.
2. By comparing the two images, there isn't a visible border added to the 'after' image. The content area remains seamless with the background.
3. There are no visible borders.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
