Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to add a subtle border or a slight shadow around the main content sections. The goal is to make these sections stand out and be more clearly defined visually.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible in the "after" image. Upon close inspection, neither new borders nor shadows have been applied to any of the content sections (e.g., the left main content column, the right Impressum/Haftungsausschluss column, or individual sections within them). The visual separation of content remains identical to the "before" image, relying solely on horizontal lines, text layout, and whitespace.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The requested visual elements (borders or shadows) are entirely absent from the "after" image. The design change instructed has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
