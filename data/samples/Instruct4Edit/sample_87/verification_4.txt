Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
   - Increase the vertical spacing between individual customer comment entries to improve readability.
   - Make the names of the reviewers (e.g., "Eckig62da", "Airbag50") visually more prominent than the comment text itself.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
   - **Visual Space between entries:** Yes, there is a clear and noticeable increase in the vertical spacing (padding/margin) between the customer comments. For example, the space between the first "Eckig62da" entry and the second "Eckig62da" entry, and between the second "Eckig62da" entry and the "Airbag50" entry, is significantly larger in the "after" image.
   - **Reviewer's name standing out:** Yes, the reviewer names ("Eckig62da", "Airbag50") have been changed from black text to red text in the "after" image. This color change makes them clearly stand out against the black comment text and the page background, fulfilling the instruction.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
   - No significant doubts or ambiguities regarding the *application* of the specified visual changes. Both aspects of the instruction (increased spacing and highlighted names) are clearly visible for the comments that are present in both views.
   - A minor observation, not directly related to the instruction's *fulfillment* but worth noting, is that the last two comments ("Raupi" and "Gonzosoft") which were partially visible in the "before" image, are now entirely out of view in the "after" image. However, the instruction focused on "adding more visual space between each entry" and "making the reviewer's name stand out more" for the existing content, which has been done for the visible entries. The instruction did not state that *all* comments must remain visible or that content should not be scrolled out of view.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
