Here is the review of the design change:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to increase the font size and visual weight (e.g., making it bold) of the "Pizzeria Delphin" name and its associated address ("Heidestr. 208, 51147 Kln") displayed at the top left of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, both "Pizzeria Delphin" and "Heidestr. 208, 51147 Kln" are noticeably larger in font size and have a significantly heavier visual weight (appearing bolded) compared to their appearance in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction specified both "font size" and "visual weight," and both aspects have been clearly applied to both the "Pizzeria Delphin" name and the "Heidestr. 208, 51147 Kln" address. The elements are located "prominently near the top of the content area" as described, and the change makes them distinctly more prominent.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
