**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the text "Online Bestellen" within its "button" context:
    *   Visually larger in size.
    *   Visually bolder in font weight.
    *   Potentially occupy more of the surrounding space, implying an increase in the size of the clickable area or the text itself to fill more space.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Larger:** Upon close inspection and direct comparison of the "Online Bestellen" text in both images, there is no discernible increase in font size. The characters appear to be the exact same height and width in both the "before" and "after" states.
    *   **Bolder:** Similarly, comparing the font weight of "Online Bestellen," there is no visible increase in the stroke thickness of the characters. The text appears to have the exact same boldness in both images.
    *   **Filling more of its available space:** Since neither the font size nor the apparent bounding box around the text has changed, the text does not fill more of its available space.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the "Online Bestellen" text in the "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image. None of the requested visual changes (larger, bolder, or filling more space) have been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
