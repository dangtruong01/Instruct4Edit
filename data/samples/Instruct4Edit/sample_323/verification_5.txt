Here's my cautious review:

**Instruction:** Change the font style of the main product name, "Stardust Vase-Sm Blue," to be a sans-serif font.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requires the font of "Stardust Vase-Sm Blue" to change from its current style (which appears to be a serif font) to a sans-serif font. A sans-serif font would noticeably lack the small decorative lines (serifs) at the ends of letter strokes.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The text "Stardust Vase-Sm Blue" clearly displays serifs (e.g., observe the 'S', 't', 'a', 'V', 'B', 'l'). It is a serif font.
    *   **After Image:** Upon close inspection, the text "Stardust Vase-Sm Blue" in the "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image. The serifs are still present on all letters, and there is no discernible change in the font's appearance. It remains a serif font.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are no visible changes to the font style of "Stardust Vase-Sm Blue" between the "before" and "after" images. The font remains a serif font, meaning the instruction to change it to a sans-serif font has not been implemented.
