**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the specific message "Sorry, we're currently out of this item" more visually prominent by changing its color to something distinct and bright, thereby making it stand out more than its original state.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the text "Sorry, we're currently out of this item" is displayed in black. In the "after" image, the exact same text is now displayed in a distinct shade of red. This color change immediately draws the eye and makes the message more noticeable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The chosen red color is clearly distinct from the original black text and the white background, and it effectively serves to make the message stand out more. While "bright" can be subjective, this specific shade of red is definitely brighter than black and is commonly used for alerts or important information, thus fulfilling the intent of the instruction. It is not a dull or dark color, and it successfully draws attention as requested. No elements appear to be missing or ambiguously implemented.
