Here's my review based on the provided instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect to the product image thumbnails to make them appear more clickable. This means looking for a faint blur or darkening around the edges of the small image at the bottom left of the screen.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the product image thumbnail (the small image of the vases in the bottom-left corner) in both the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible visual difference. No shadow effect, subtle or otherwise, has been added to the thumbnail in the "after" image. The thumbnail appears identical in both states.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The intended visual change (a subtle shadow) is entirely missing. There is no visual evidence of any shadow being applied to the thumbnail.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
