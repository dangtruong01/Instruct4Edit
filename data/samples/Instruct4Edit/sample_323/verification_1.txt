Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to make both instances of the "Sign up to continue" buttons "fully rounded." This means their corners should have a border-radius sufficient to make the ends of the button appear as perfect semicircles, rather than just having subtly rounded corners.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, the change is not visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, both "Sign up to continue" buttons (the one beneath "Stardust Vase-Sm Blue" and the one below the "Sorry, we're currently out of this item..." text) appear identical in shape and corner rounding in both images. They retain their original rectangular shape with only very slight corner rounding, not the "fully rounded" appearance requested.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the buttons' appearance has not changed at all between the "before" and "after" images. The requested visual change was not implemented for either button.
