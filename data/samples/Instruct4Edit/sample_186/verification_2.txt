Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Increase the font size of the main heading on the page. The main heading is "Tucson Personal Advets for you to Look Try Right here".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The font size of the heading is noticeably larger in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
