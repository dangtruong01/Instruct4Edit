Here's the breakdown:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requests the footer widgets to be stacked vertically on smaller screens instead of side-by-side. The instruction itself is open to interpretation. It can be taken that the footer is "Keep Up With Keith!" and the "Contact Keith" area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The images are identical. There is no evidence of a change in the footer.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The "after" image doesn't exhibit any change to the layout of the footer widgets, as they remain side-by-side.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
