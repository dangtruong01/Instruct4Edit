Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the main content area to visually separate it from the sidebar. Since there's no sidebar visible, I interpret it as adding a border around all the main content on the page.
2. Looking at the "after" image, there is no visible border around the main content area compared to the "before" image.
3. There is no apparent border added to the main content area in the second image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
