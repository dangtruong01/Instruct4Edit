Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to center the copyright information in the footer. This means the text at the bottom of the page, specifically the lines starting with "© 2021" and "Non-profit web design by Boxcar Studio", should be visually centered horizontally on the page.
2. In the "after" image, the copyright information is visibly centered compared to the "before" image where it was left-aligned.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The text is clearly centered.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
