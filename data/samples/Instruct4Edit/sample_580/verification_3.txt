Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle background color to the main content area. This is meant to visually separate the content from the rest of the page, making it stand out.
2. In the second image, there's a very subtle gray background color applied to the main content area (the area containing most of the text). This is noticeable when compared to the original image, which has a plain white background.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements; the subtle background color is applied as described.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
