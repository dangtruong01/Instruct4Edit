Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add more spacing (padding/margin) around the site title and description in the header area. This should create a more visually distinct separation of the header content from the rest of the page.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there appears to be no noticeable difference in the spacing around the site title "Автосалон MyCityCar" and the site description.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the implementation is non-existent.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
