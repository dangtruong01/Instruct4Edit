Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a more modern and readable font for the main heading and all body text. This means the font used for titles, headings, and the general body text should be changed.
2. Comparing the two images, there is a slight change in the font. It looks like the headings and body text have been changed to a different font. It appears more readable than the original image.
3. There are no immediate doubts or ambiguities. The change is visible and consistent across the relevant text elements.

Final verdict:
