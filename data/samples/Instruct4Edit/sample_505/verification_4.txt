Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the space between the heading and the body text for each legal area described. I will need to look at the spacing between titles like "Arbeitsrecht:" and the text below it.
2. Comparing the two images, the space between the headings and body text of each legal area (Arbeitsrecht, Ausländerrecht, etc.) appears to be slightly increased.
3. The change is subtle but visible. There is no ambiguity.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
