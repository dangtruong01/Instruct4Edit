Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the menu buttons on the right look more cohesive and integrated. This can be achieved by removing the borders or giving them a more modern appearance.
2. In the after image, there is no discernible change in the appearance of the menu buttons. The borders are still visible, and the overall look remains the same.
3. Since there is no visible change related to the menu buttons, the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
