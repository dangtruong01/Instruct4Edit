Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add space (padding/margin) around the "Add to Cart" button to make it less cramped. This means increasing the visual distance between the button's borders and the surrounding elements.
2. Looking at the images, there is no clearly identifiable "Add to Cart" button. The form next to the price might be intended as an add-to-cart section, but there is no distinct button. It is simply an input field and a button to submit the form, potentially adding the item to a cart. There is no clearly visible change in spacing around this area either.
3. Because there is no visible button or obvious change in spacing, it is impossible to verify that the instruction was correctly implemented.
