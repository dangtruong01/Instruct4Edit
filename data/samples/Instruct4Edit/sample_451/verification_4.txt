Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the font size and line height of the category links in the sidebar to make them smaller and less cluttered.
2. Comparing the two images, it appears the category links in the sidebar (the list of categories such as "料理写真集", "和食", "洋食", etc.) do have a smaller font size and line height in the second image compared to the first. The spacing between the lines is also reduced.
3. There are no visible ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
