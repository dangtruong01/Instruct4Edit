Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main article card. This should make the card appear to "float" slightly above the background.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any shadow added to the main article card in the second image.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
