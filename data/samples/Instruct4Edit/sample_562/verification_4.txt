Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to give the sidebar widgets (the sections on the right side of the image) a unified look. This should be achieved by adding a consistent border or background color to each section.
2. The second image appears to have applied a light grey background to the "RAČTE VSTOUPIT!" section. Also, the "LODNÍ DENÍKY V MAILU" section already had a background color.
3. The application of the instruction is partial. Only one of the identified sidebar widgets received the described treatment, and the "LODNÍ DENÍKY V MAILU" section already had a background before the design change.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
