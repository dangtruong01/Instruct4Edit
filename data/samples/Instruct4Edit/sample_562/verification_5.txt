Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the footer stick to the bottom of the page, regardless of the amount of content. This means that even if the content is short, the footer should be at the very bottom of the browser window/page.
2. Comparing the two images, the position of the footer is identical in both. It is not sticking to the bottom of the page, instead it appears to be directly below the content, as is typical behavior.
3. Since there is no visible change in the footer's position, and it does not appear to stick to the bottom of the page, the instruction has not been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
