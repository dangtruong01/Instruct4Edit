Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the main header background image to be more visually appealing and less blurry. However, there is no clear visual element that could be identified as the "main header background image" in either of the images. The instruction is vague.
2. Since there is no visible "main header background image", it's impossible to determine if the change was applied.
3. The instruction itself is ambiguous.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
