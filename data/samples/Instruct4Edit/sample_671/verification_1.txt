Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing (whitespace) between major content sections on the page. Specifically, it mentions "large content blocks" such as "forum categories" and the "statistics area," to give them more visual breathing room.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Between Forum Categories:** Yes, there is a clear and visible increase in vertical space between the first and second large table-like blocks (which represent forum categories), and also between the second and third forum category blocks. The grey horizontal separator lines now have more whitespace above and below them.
    *   **Before Statistics Area:** No, there is no visible increase in vertical space between the third forum category block and the large content block at the very bottom, which appears to be the "statistics area" (starting with "50:1 Q" and including other numerical data). The space around the "cookies" link and leading into this bottom statistics section appears to be identical in both the "before" and "after" images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction uses the phrase "such as the forum categories and the statistics area," which implies that the change should be applied to all relevant "large content blocks." While the spacing between the forum categories was successfully increased, the spacing directly preceding the "statistics area" (a clearly identifiable large content block at the bottom) was not modified. Therefore, the instruction was not fully or comprehensively implemented across all identified types of large content blocks.
