Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to modify all input fields and buttons by giving their corners a subtle roundness. This means any rectangular input fields (like text boxes) and distinct button elements should have their sharp 90-degree corners replaced with a slightly curved, rounded appearance.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images, paying close attention to any elements that resemble input fields or buttons.
    *   **Top input field:** In both images, the input field at the very top (below the main header) appears to have sharp, 90-degree corners. There is no visible difference in the corner shape between the "before" and "after" versions.
    *   **"cookies" button:** Located at the bottom right of the main content area, this element appears to be a button. In both images, its corners are sharp and angular, showing no signs of rounding.
    *   **Other elements:** Throughout the page, other elements that might be interactive (like navigation arrows, or image links in the footer) also retain their original sharp corners. The instruction specifically mentions "input fields and buttons," and these are the primary candidates for the change.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no discernible change in the corner radius of *any* element that could be classified as an input field or a button. The "after" image looks identical to the "before" image concerning the sharpness of corners on these specific UI elements. The instruction states "all input fields and buttons," and neither the primary input field nor the most obvious button on the page have been altered.
