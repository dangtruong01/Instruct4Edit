Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation links in the footer larger and easier to read.
2. The font size of the navigation links in the footer ("ご利用ガイド", "利用規約特定商取引法に基づく表記会社情報", "プライバシーポリシー") appears to be exactly the same in both images.
3. There are no changes made to the footer navigation links in the 'after' image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
