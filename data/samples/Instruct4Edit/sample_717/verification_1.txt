Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the padding around the site logo within the header. This means the logo should have more space above, below, and to the sides, separating it visually from other elements in the header.
2. Comparing the two images, it's difficult to identify which one is the logo, since there is no clear logo present in the header of either image. If one of the small elements in the upper area is the logo, then the padding does not seem to have changed significantly.
3. It is difficult to discern which is the logo.

Final verdict:
