Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical empty space between each distinct article preview block (comprising an image, title, and description) in the main content area. This means the gap below one article block and above the next should become larger.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon close comparison of the two images, the vertical spacing between the article preview blocks appears to be exactly the same in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in the white space separating these content blocks.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The images are virtually identical in the area specified by the instruction. The requested visual change (adding more vertical space) is not present.

Final verdict:
