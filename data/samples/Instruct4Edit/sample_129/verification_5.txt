Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the "navigation path text" (identified as "ホーム > 面談" at the top of the page) darker in color. The purpose is to enhance its readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is **not clearly visible**. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the color of the navigation path text "ホーム > 面談" appears to be precisely the same light grey shade in both versions. There is no discernible difference in its darkness or color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction was to change the color to a *darker shade*. Visually, the text color has remained unchanged. Therefore, the instruction has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
