Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the visual prominence, aesthetic appeal, and readability of the keyword tags in the sidebar. This includes:
    *   Making the overall tag elements appear larger (likely through increased padding rather than just font size).
    *   Changing the sharp, square corners of the tags to a more circular, rounded shape.
    *   Increasing the horizontal and vertical spacing between individual tags to provide more clear separation and improve "breathing room."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Larger:** Yes, the tags are clearly larger in the "after" image. While the font size of the text inside the tags appears consistent, the padding around the text within each tag has been significantly increased, making the entire clickable area and visual footprint of each tag much bigger.
    *   **More rounded corners:** Yes, the corners of all keyword tags are distinctly and significantly more rounded in the "after" image compared to the sharp, 90-degree corners in the "before" image.
    *   **More breathing room between each other:** Yes, there is a clear and noticeable increase in both horizontal and, especially, vertical spacing between the tags. The rows of tags are no longer tightly packed, and there is ample white space separating them, improving their individuality and readability.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, all three components of the instruction – "larger," "more rounded corners," and "more breathing room between each other" – have been clearly and completely implemented in the modified image. The visual changes are unambiguous and fully align with the provided instruction.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
