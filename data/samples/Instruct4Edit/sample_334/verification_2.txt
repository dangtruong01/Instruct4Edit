**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific visual changes for the "newsletter signup box":
    *   A distinct, light background color.
    *   A soft, rounded border.
    The overall goal is to make the box more noticeable.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**

    *   **Identifying the "newsletter signup box":** This refers to the section containing "S'inscrire à la newsletter" (Subscribe to the newsletter) and the "E-mail *" input field.

    *   **Distinct, light background color:**
        *   **Before:** The "newsletter signup box" has the same white background as the rest of the page content.
        *   **After:** The entire area of the "newsletter signup box" now has a very light gray background. This color is distinct from the pure white of the surrounding page and is indeed light. This part of the instruction appears to be implemented.

    *   **Soft, rounded border:**
        *   **Before:** There is no distinct border around the entire "newsletter signup box". The input field itself has sharp, 90-degree corners.
        *   **After:** A light gray border has been added around the entire "newsletter signup box" (the area with the new light background). However, upon close inspection, the corners of this new border are sharp (90-degree angles), not soft or rounded. While the input field *inside* the box might have a *very* slight rounding, the instruction refers to the "newsletter signup box" itself having "a soft, rounded border," which implies the entire containing element. The main enclosing border is not rounded.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The "distinct, light background color" is clearly present and correctly applied.
    *   The "soft, rounded border" is *not* clearly applied. A border has been added, but its corners are sharp, not soft or rounded as explicitly requested in the instruction. This is a significant omission of a key visual characteristic.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
