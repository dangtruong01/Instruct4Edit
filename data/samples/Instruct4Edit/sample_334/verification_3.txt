Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Increase the space between lines of text in all the article paragraphs to make them easier to read.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the `line-height` (vertical spacing between baselines of text lines) for all blocks of text that constitute the main article content. This change is intended to improve readability by providing more visual breathing room between lines.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly and consistently visible throughout the main body of the article.
    *   Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the line spacing within paragraphs like "Cette petite chronique concerne nos amis américains...", "Que nonnn : il faut vous dire que j’ai reçu...", and "Vous êtes happé dans un mélange..." is significantly wider in the "after" image.
    *   Even the list-like section starting with "Premises pour..." (which functions like a series of short paragraphs or long list items within the article context) shows a clear increase in spacing between each line/item.
    *   The increased spacing makes the text blocks in the "after" image appear less dense and more open, directly contributing to improved readability as per the instruction's goal.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifies "all the article paragraphs," and the change has been applied uniformly to all identifiable article text blocks, including longer paragraphs and shorter list-like entries that form part of the main content. The change is distinct and visually impactful.
