Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the visual spacing and aesthetic of the social media icons in the footer. Specifically, it requires:
    *   Adding more space around and between the icons ("visual separation").
    *   Introducing "slight rounding," likely to the new elements or containers surrounding the icons, given the icons themselves are already circular.
    *   The overall goal is to make the icons "feel less cramped."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible and effective in the "after" image.
    *   **Visual separation:** In the "before" image, the social media icons (RSS, Facebook, Twitter) are stacked vertically with minimal space directly between them. In the "after" image, each icon is now placed inside a distinct, individual white background box. This creates significant visual separation around each icon and effectively separates them from each other, providing much more breathing room.
    *   **Slight rounding:** While the icons themselves were already round, the new white background boxes enclosing each icon in the "after" image clearly feature slightly rounded corners. This fulfills the "slight rounding" aspect of the instruction by applying it to the elements visually separating the icons.
    *   **Less cramped:** As a direct result of the added spacing and individual containers, the icons in the "after" image undeniably appear less cramped and more organized compared to their state in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The implementation precisely matches all aspects of the instruction. The interpretation of "rounding to the social media icons" as rounding their new containers is logical and effectively applied, while the visual separation is prominently achieved.

**Final verdict:**
