Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main content area (specifically the article text column, but implicitly the entire article block including title, image, and text) narrower and centered on the page. This should result in more empty space on both the left and right sides, contributing to a cleaner aesthetic.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Shrink width:** Yes, the main content column, encompassing the title, image, and all paragraphs of text, is visibly narrower in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. The lines of text are shorter.
    *   **Center on the page:** Yes, in the "before" image, the content is clearly left-aligned, leaving a large empty space on the right. In the "after" image, the main content column is horizontally centered, with roughly equal empty space on both the left and right sides.
    *   **More empty space on the sides:** As a direct consequence of shrinking the width and centering, there is significantly more white space on both flanks of the article in the "after" image.
    *   **Cleaner look:** The added whitespace and symmetrical centering indeed contribute to a cleaner, more balanced visual presentation.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifically referred to the "article text column," and the entire main article content block (which houses the text) has been consistently treated as a single unit for this transformation. The header and footer elements remain full-width, which is standard and doesn't contradict the instruction focused on the "article text column."
