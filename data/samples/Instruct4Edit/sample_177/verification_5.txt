2.  **Visibility of Change:** The "after" image shows the headings "Monika Krause, Queen of Condoms" and "Memoir of a Sex Educator in Revolutionary Cuba" are a bit darker than in the "before" image, indicating an increase in boldness.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** While there is a subtle change in the appearance, it is difficult to determine if the changes are very significant or sufficiently prominent.
