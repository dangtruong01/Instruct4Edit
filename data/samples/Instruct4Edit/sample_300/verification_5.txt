Step-by-step justification:
1.  The instruction is to reduce the padding around the main content area. This means the whitespace between the text/elements and the edges of the main content area should be smaller in the "after" image.
2.  The "after" image shows a slight reduction in the padding on the sides and top compared to the "before" image.
3.  The change is subtle, but visible, and the instruction is successfully implemented.

Final verdict:
