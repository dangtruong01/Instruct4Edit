Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to darken the border of the search bar.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the border of the search bar appears slightly darker in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

Final verdict:
