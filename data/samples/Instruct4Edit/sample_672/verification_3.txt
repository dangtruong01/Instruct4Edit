**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modify the visual appearance of all interactive elements identified as "buttons" on the page. Specifically, these buttons should adopt:
    *   **Softer rounded corners:** Changing sharp or default corners to a more circular, gentle curve.
    *   **A distinct background color:** Shifting from its original background (likely a neutral or default browser style) to a more prominent and different color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible for the 'Search' button in the "Primary Sidebar" section.
    *   **Before Image:** The 'Search' button has sharp, almost 90-degree corners and a very light, almost white background with a thin border, appearing quite default.
    *   **After Image:** The 'Search' button now prominently features significantly softer rounded corners. Its background color has changed from light/default to a solid, distinct blue, clearly differentiating it.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction specifies "all visible buttons on the page". Upon careful review of both images, the 'Search' button in the sidebar is the *only* element visually styled and functioning as a traditional "button" (i.e., a clickable element with a distinct background and border, rather than a plain text link). All other interactive elements (like navigation links, archive links, category links, and the "Skip to content" link) are presented as standard text hyperlinks.
    *   Given that the only visually identifiable button on the page ('Search' button) has fully adopted both specified style changes (softer rounded corners and a distinct background color), there are no visible doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements related to the instruction's application to *actual buttons*.
