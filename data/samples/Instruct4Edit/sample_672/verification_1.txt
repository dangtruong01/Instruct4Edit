Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to modify the website's main title, 'sinfullywickedbookreviews.com', by making it significantly larger and bolder.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the title 'sinfullywickedbookreviews.com' in the "after" image is distinctly larger in font size and visually bolder (heavier font weight) compared to the "before" image. The color has also changed from blue to black, which often accompanies a change from a hyperlink style to a main heading style, further emphasizing its prominence.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, the changes are clear and directly address both parts of the instruction: "significantly larger" and "bolder." The level of increase in size and boldness appears sufficient to "grab attention" as intended.

**Final verdict:**
