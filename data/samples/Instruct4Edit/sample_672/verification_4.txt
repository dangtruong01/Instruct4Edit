As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the "before" and "after" images to assess the implementation of the instruction.

**Instruction:** Increase the empty space that separates the main article content from the sidebar on the right.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The intended change is to visibly widen the horizontal gap (the "gutter" or "whitespace") between the main article content column (on the left) and the "Primary Sidebar" content (on the right).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Main Article Content:** Upon close inspection, the main article content column in the "after" image is noticeably narrower than in the "before" image. This is evidenced by text lines that were previously single lines now wrapping onto two lines (e.g., "Although the concept of a lottery is old, this practice has evolved..." is a single line in "before" but wraps in "after").
    *   **Sidebar Position:** The "Primary Sidebar" and its contents (Search, Recent Posts, etc.) appear to maintain their horizontal position relative to the right edge of the overall page layout in both images.
    *   **Left Alignment:** The left edge of the main article content (e.g., the "Buying a Lottery Online" title) remains consistently aligned across both images.
    *   **Resulting Space:** Since the main article content's left edge is fixed, and its width has decreased, its right edge has consequently shifted further to the left. As the sidebar's left edge has remained relatively static, the horizontal distance between the main article's right boundary and the sidebar's left boundary has increased. This creates a visually wider empty space separating the two content blocks.

    The increase in empty space, while achieved by narrowing the main content column rather than just adding direct padding/margin without other changes, is clearly visible and effectively implemented.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the visual outcome. The instruction was to "increase the empty space," and this has been clearly achieved. The method by which it was achieved (reducing the content width to push its right edge left) is effective in fulfilling the instruction.
