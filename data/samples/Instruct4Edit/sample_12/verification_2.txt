Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Increase the space between the navigation menu items. This would mean the horizontal spacing between the "Menu" text/button and the social media icons would increase.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. There is no clear increase in spacing.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
