Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The background image of the header should now extend horizontally to cover the entire width of the header section.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The "after" image looks identical to the "before" image. There's no apparent stretching of the header background image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction seems clear, and the expected change (full width background image in the header) is not visible.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
