❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to move the sidebar from the side to the bottom of the page on mobile screens. However, there's no indication or visual comparison between a "desktop" view and a "mobile" view. The provided images appear to be the same.
2. The sidebar appears to be in the same place in both images. There's no visual change to indicate it has been moved.
3. The instruction specifies a change that applies *only* to mobile views. The images provided do not show different views or indicate mobile vs. desktop views. Without a clear visual comparison between mobile and desktop, it is impossible to determine if the instruction was implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
