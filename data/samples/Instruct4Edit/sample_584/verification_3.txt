Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the article content. This means that there should be a visible line or shadow effect around the main text of the article in the "after" image that isn't present in the "before" image.
2. Visually, in the "after" image, there is no discernible border around the article content, just as in the "before" image.
3. There are no visual elements suggesting a border has been added.

Final verdict:
