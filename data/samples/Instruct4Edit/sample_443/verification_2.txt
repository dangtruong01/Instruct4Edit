Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the video to make it stand out. The "video" in this case refers to the embedded video player.
2. By comparing the before and after images, I cannot detect any difference in the appearance of the video player. There is no visible shadow added.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
