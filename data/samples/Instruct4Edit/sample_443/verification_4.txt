Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color scheme of the "chat window" to a softer blue and darker gray, making it less harsh than the original black and light blue. However, the provided images do not show a chat window. Instead, the image shows content related to "BitcarCom."
2. Since there's no chat window visible in either of the images, it's impossible to verify if the instruction was applied.
3. The instruction is unclear in its applicability because there is no chat window present in the provided visual.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
