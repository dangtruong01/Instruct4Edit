Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The background color of the section containing navigation links, including "uazbuka.ru" should be a darker shade of gray.
2.  **Visibility of the Change:** There is no visible change in the background color of the navigation links section in the "after" image. Both images look identical.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The change is not visible.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
