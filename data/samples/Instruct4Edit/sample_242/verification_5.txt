Here's my review based on the provided images:

**Instruction:** Increase the space between the main article content and the sidebar area.

**Step-by-step justification:**
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The goal is to make the horizontal white space between the primary content column (the article text on the left) and the secondary content column (the "Recent Posts" sidebar on the right) wider.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the increase in space is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the left article content block appears to be narrower, and the right sidebar has more breathing room, resulting in a significantly wider gutter between the two columns compared to the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the instruction was followed clearly and precisely. The space has been successfully increased.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
