Here's my analysis based on the visual comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the color of the subheadings within the main article content. The purpose of this change is to make these subheadings visually distinct and help them stand out from the surrounding body text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, all subheadings (e.g., "Business Trip Massage & Business Trip Massage Shop", "My stress relief", "The Convenience of 7 Booking", "A Variety of Massage Options", "How to Book Your 서귀포출장안마 Experience", "Contact Us", "Select Your Massage", "Schedule Your Session", "Enjoy Your Massage", "Conclusion") are black, matching the color of the body text (though bolded and slightly larger). In the "after" image, these same subheadings have all been changed to a distinct light blue color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. All identified subheadings within the main article content have consistently been changed to the new color. The new color clearly differentiates them from the body text. The change is uniform and applies only to the elements specified as subheadings.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
