Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing (or "space") between the main article title ("서리포출장마: Your Ultimate Business Trip Massage Experience") and the metadata below it (the author and date, "November 9, 2023 by SA Admin").
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, in the "after" image, there is a distinct increase in the vertical whitespace between the article title and the line containing "November 9, 2023 by SA Admin". This line has visibly moved further down from the title compared to the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clear, unambiguous, and directly corresponds to the instruction given.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
