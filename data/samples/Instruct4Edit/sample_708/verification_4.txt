Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the size of the social media icons in the footer.
2. Comparing the two images, there are no social media icons in either the original or the modified image. The image provided in both files seems to be a logo.
3. Since the instruction specifies changing social media icons and there are no social media icons present in the provided images, it is impossible to verify if the instruction was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
