Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the font color of the menu items in the header to be a bit brighter and more visible.
2. By comparing the two images, I can see that the menu items in the header ("Hem", "Nyheter", "Tävling", "S&P", "Klubbar", "Sponsorer") appear to have a slightly lighter/brighter font color in the second image than in the first image. This makes them more visible against the dark background.
3. There are no obvious ambiguities. The change is subtle, but noticeable.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
