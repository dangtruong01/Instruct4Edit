Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for padding to be added around the main content area. This means increasing the space between the edges of the content (text, titles, and the bottom image) and the borders of the surrounding container (in this case, the dark gray background).
2. By comparing the before and after images, it's visually noticeable that there's slightly more space around the text and the image at the bottom in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. The text and the image appear to have more room around them, suggesting padding has been added.
3. The padding appears to be added equally to the left, right, top and bottom of the main content area.

Final verdict:
