Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the padding/spacing around the logo.
2. Comparing the two images, it seems like the top, right and bottom padding around the logo have slightly increased. However, there is also an element right next to the logo and the spacing between them has not been adjusted.
3. The horizontal spacing on the left of the logo seems unchanged.

Final verdict:
