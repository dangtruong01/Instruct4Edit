Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the "Détails sur le poste" block on the right side of the image.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible border around the "LOCALISATION" block in the after image.
3. It is possible that "LOCALISATION" block corresponds to "Détails sur le poste", but without more context, it is not possible to say for sure. Either way, no border is visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
