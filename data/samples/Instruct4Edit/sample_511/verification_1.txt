Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the logo in the top header bigger and more prominent. This implies an increase in the logo's size and visual weight.
2. Visually comparing the "before" and "after" images, it is clear that the logo in the top left corner is significantly larger in the "after" image than in the "before" image. The increased size also makes it more prominent.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible and directly addresses the instruction.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
