Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to change the social media sharing icons to a more visually appealing style.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The images are identical. There are no visible changes to social media icons or their style.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction was not implemented, therefore the changes are missing.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
