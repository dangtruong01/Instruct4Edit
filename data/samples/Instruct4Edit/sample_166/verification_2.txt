Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction aims to consolidate the author's name and publication date onto a single line, aligning them to the right side of the display.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the author's name (Marco Lanari) and the date are now on the same line and are right-aligned in the image provided.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

Final verdict:
