Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect to the header to make it stand out from the content below.
2. After careful comparison, there is no visible shadow effect added to the header in the "after" image. It appears identical to the "before" image in this regard.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is simply not visible.

Final verdict:
