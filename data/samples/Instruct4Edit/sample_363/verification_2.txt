Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase padding, especially on the sides, of the main navigation items. The navigation items are assumed to be "HOME", "会社概要", "関連会社", "営業品目", "採用情報", "お問い合わせ" at the top left of the page.
2. Comparing the two images, the padding of these items on the top left of the page is visibly increased.
3. There are no ambiguities, and the change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
