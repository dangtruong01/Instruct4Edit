Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to apply a consistent background color to the "営業所" and "関連会社" sections, choosing one of the existing colors. This implies that currently, the background colors are different, and the goal is to make them the same.
2. Looking at the first image, the "営業所" section has a distinct light blue background, while the "関連会社" section has a light yellow background. In the second image, the "営業所" section still has the light blue background, and the "関連会社" section still has the light yellow background. There is no visible change to the background colors of either section.
3. Therefore, the instruction to make the background colors consistent has not been implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
