Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to move the mobile menu button at the bottom slightly to the right, so it has more space between it and the "Home" button.
2. Comparing the two images, it is not possible to see any movement to the mobile menu button. The positions of the "Home" and "Menu" buttons seem exactly the same.
3. There is no visible change.

Final verdict:
