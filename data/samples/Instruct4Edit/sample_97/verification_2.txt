Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to transform two distinct, separated navigation lists into a single, unified list. This consolidation should also involve removing any visually and textually identical ("duplicate") links that appeared in both original lists, ensuring they appear only once in the combined list.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    -   In the "before" image, there are two distinct blocks of navigation links: one headed "Accueil" and another headed "Publications", separated by space. Both lists also contained an item labeled "Archives".
    -   In the "after" image, these two blocks have been merged into one continuous list. The "Publications" heading and its associated links are now seamlessly integrated below the "Accueil" links, maintaining a consistent visual hierarchy and indentation.
    -   Crucially, the "Archives" link, which was present in both original sets, now appears only once in the consolidated list.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifically mentioned "duplicate category navigation links." "Archives" was a clear textual duplicate across the two sets and has been correctly consolidated. While "Evénements annuels" and "Evénements" appear as separate items in the consolidated list, they are not exact textual duplicates. Given that the clear textual duplicate ("Archives") was handled correctly, the implementation adheres to the strict interpretation of "duplicate" as per the instruction. The two sets of links are now unequivocally presented as a single, clearly identifiable list.

Final verdict:
