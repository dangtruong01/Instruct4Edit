Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for an increase in the vertical space between the main paragraphs within the article content. This means the empty space separating blocks of text (paragraphs) should be visually larger in the "after" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, upon careful comparison of the main article body, particularly in the section "Oser l'espérance Une décennie de solidarité, ça se fête !", the vertical spacing between distinct paragraphs is visibly larger in the "after" image. For example, the gap between the paragraph starting "Six cent cinquante femmes..." and the subsequent paragraph starting "Il y a dix ans..." is noticeably wider. This increased spacing is consistently applied throughout the main article content.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction was clear and the visual change directly corresponds to it. No elements are missing from the implementation of this specific instruction.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
