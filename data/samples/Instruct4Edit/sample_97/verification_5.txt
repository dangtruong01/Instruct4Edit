Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to create more vertical empty space between the main body of the article and the subsequent content blocks. Specifically, it targets the spacing before and within the "next/previous article navigation" section and the "footer" section, pushing them further away from the main article and each other.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **Space after Main Article Content:** There is a significant increase in the vertical space between the last paragraph of the main article content (ending with "...dans la société.") and the "Navigation de l'article" heading. This gap is noticeably larger in the "after" image.
    *   **Space between "Navigation de l'article" and "Contactez-nous":** The vertical space between the bottom of the "Navigation de l'article" content and the "Contactez-nous" heading has also increased.
    *   **Space between "Contactez-nous" and "Infoslettre" (Footer area):** The vertical space between the end of the "Contactez-nous" section and the "Infoslettre" heading (which appears to be part of the footer or a section immediately preceding it) has also clearly increased.
    *   **Overall layout:** The entire lower portion of the page, starting from the "Navigation de l'article" section downwards, appears to be pushed further down, creating a much airier layout in the "after" image, consistent with "overall vertical spacing."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was "Increase the overall vertical spacing between the main article content and the sections below it, like the next/previous article navigation and the footer." This has been comprehensively applied. The main article content is now clearly separated from the subsequent sections, and these sections themselves have increased spacing, contributing to the "overall" effect.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
