Here's my review:

**Instruction:** Transform the "Écrivez-nous" and "Faire un don" actions in the footer into visually distinct buttons.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the appearance of "Écrivez-nous" and "Faire un don" from simple text links to elements that visually resemble interactive buttons. This typically implies a background color, padding, possibly a border, and text color that makes them stand out and appear clickable, distinct from regular text or unstyled links.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** In the "Contactez-nous" section, "Écrivez-nous" and "Faire un don" are rendered as standard blue text links, indistinguishable in style from the "Adresse" or "Téléphone" labels above them, or other links on the page. They do not have any button-like styling (no background, padding, or distinct shape).
    *   **After Image:** In the "Contactez-nous" section, both "Écrivez-nous" and "Faire un don" have been transformed. They now feature a solid blue background, white text, and visible padding around the text, giving them a clear rectangular shape. This styling makes them visually distinct from plain text and other links, clearly presenting them as interactive buttons.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is very clear and unambiguous. Both elements specified in the instruction have been transformed into buttons that are visually distinct from their previous state and from surrounding text. The intent of "visually distinct buttons" has been fully met.
