Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requested that the main site name and a descriptive tagline be made clearly visible at the very top of the page. This implies adding or re-emphasizing existing elements to stand out as the site's primary identifier.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, there is no prominent site name or tagline at the top. The "after" image introduces "L'Autre Parole" as a large, distinct heading, immediately followed by "Féministe et chrétienne" as a descriptive tagline. These elements are positioned at the very top of the content area, making them highly visible and clearly identifying the site.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The addition of "L'Autre Parole" and "Féministe et chrétienne" directly addresses the instruction. Their placement and visual hierarchy at the top make them "clearly visible" as the "main site name and its descriptive tagline."

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
