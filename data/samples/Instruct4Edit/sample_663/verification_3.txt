Here's a step-by-step justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction requires two specific visual changes to the "main headings within the article content":
    *   Increase their font size.
    *   Bold their text.
The purpose is to make them stand out.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Let's examine the main headings:
*   **"Установка и игра в слот «Золото Амиго»"**:
    *   In the "before" image, it's a regular-sized, non-bolded text.
    *   In the "after" image, it is clearly larger in font size and visibly bolded.
*   **"Особенности слота «Золото Амиго»"**:
    *   Similar to the above, it's regular in "before" and clearly larger and bolded in "after."
*   **"Джекпот слота «Золото Амиго»"**:
    *   Again, regular in "before," and clearly larger and bolded in "after."
*   **"Заключение о слоте «Золото Амиго»"**:
    *   Consistent with the others, it's regular in "before" and clearly larger and bolded in "after."

All identified main headings within the article content have undergone both the font size increase and bolding. The changes are distinct and make the headings stand out as intended.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The instruction was precise, and the implementation is consistent across all relevant elements. The changes are clear, unambiguous, and fully address both parts of the instruction (font size increase and bolding).

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
