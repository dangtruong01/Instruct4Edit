Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction mandates adding a subtle visual indicator, specifically a light background highlight, to any item in the main navigation menu when a user hovers over it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, all main navigation items (Обзоры, Игры, Статьи, Политика конфиденциальности) appear as plain black text. In the "after" image, the item "Статьи" clearly shows a light grey background highlight behind the text. This visually demonstrates the implementation of the requested hover effect, as if the mouse cursor were hovering over that specific item.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is precisely what was instructed: a subtle, light background highlight on a main navigation item. The presence of this highlight on "Статьи" in the "after" image, where it was absent in the "before" image, serves as a clear visual confirmation that the hover state styling has been applied.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
