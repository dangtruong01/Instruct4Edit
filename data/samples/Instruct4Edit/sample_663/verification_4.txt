Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to enhance the visual presence of the "author information section" at the bottom of the article. This is to be achieved by adding two distinct visual elements:
    *   A soft background color.
    *   A light border.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Identification of the section:** In both images, just above the "Архивы" (Archives) section, there is a block of content that includes an avatar image, the text "Слот «Золото Амиго»" and two bullet points ("— Bejeweled 2 Counts" and "— Slot-machine Count Dracula —"). This is the section targeted by the instruction.
    *   **Soft background color:** In the "before" image, this section blends seamlessly with the white background of the page. In the "after" image, a distinct, very light gray background color has been applied to this entire block, clearly separating it from the rest of the page content. This color is indeed "soft."
    *   **Light border:** In the "before" image, there is no border around this section. In the "after" image, a subtle, thin, light gray border is visible enclosing the entire section. This border is "light" as instructed.
    *   **Visual presence:** The application of both the background color and the border successfully gives this section more visual presence, making it stand out as a distinct content block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The "author information section" was correctly identified and the changes were applied to the entire intended area.
    *   Both a soft background color and a light border are clearly present.
    *   There are no ambiguities; the changes are straightforward and visible.
    *   No elements from the instruction appear to be missing or only partially done.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
