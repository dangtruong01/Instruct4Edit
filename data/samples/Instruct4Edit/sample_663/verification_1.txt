Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aimed to increase the size and visual prominence of the main site title "Spark" located in the top left corner of the page.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, this change is not visible. The "after" image does not display the user interface at all. Instead, it shows a text description of *how* the change would be implemented (e.g., adding a CSS class), but it does not show the visual outcome on the webpage. The original content, including the "Spark" title, is entirely absent from the second image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, significant missing elements. The "after" image completely lacks the UI context from the "before" image. Without any visual representation of the webpage or the "Spark" title, it is impossible to verify if the instruction was visually applied. The image provided is a technical note on implementation, not a visual design outcome.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
