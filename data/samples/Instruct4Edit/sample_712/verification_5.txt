Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the menu items in the navigation bar (under "Vai al contenuto").
2. Comparing the two images, the space between "ProLoco Castiglione Asti - La Castiglionese", "Conti", "Manifestazioni" and "La Storica Fagiolata" does not seem to have changed.
3. I have doubts whether the spacing has been changed at all.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
