Step-by-step justification:
1. The intention is to add a subtle shadow effect to the main content area. The main content area appears to be the white background section between the top navigation bar and the "Lascia un commento" section.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible difference in the white background area. There is no shadow effect on either image.
3. The shadow effect seems to be entirely missing.

Final verdict:
