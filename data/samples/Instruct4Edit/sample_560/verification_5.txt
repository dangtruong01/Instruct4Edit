Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to move the copyright information to the bottom left corner and align the language links to the bottom right corner.
2. Comparing the two images, the copyright information appears to be in the same place in both images (centered). Similarly, the language links appear to be in the same place. The requested alignment is not visible in the second image.
3. There is no change in the location of the copyright information or the language links, so the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
