Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to center the form inputs and labels within their table cells. This means both horizontally and vertically centering the content within the cells.
2. By visually inspecting the images, I cannot see any changes in the alignment of the labels or input fields. They still appear to be aligned to the left, and not centered.
3. There is no visible evidence that the requested change has been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
