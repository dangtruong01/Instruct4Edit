Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation links at the top of the page. The navigation links are "Apps", "Outils", "Services", "Drôle", "Jeux", and "Casse-têtes".
2. Comparing the before and after images, the spacing between these links appears to be the same.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
