Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow behind the white layout container to make it stand out from the light green background.
2. Comparing the before and after images, it is difficult to visually detect any shadow added to the white layout container.
3. There is no visible difference between the images, so it's impossible to tell if the instruction was implemented or not.

Final verdict:
