Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the green navigation bar at the top of the page slightly darker and less saturated. This means the green color should be less vibrant and closer to a darker shade of green.
2. Comparing the two images, the green navigation bar appears to be visually identical in both images. There is no visible difference in darkness or saturation.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
