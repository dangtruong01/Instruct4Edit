Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the "Sign Up" and "Log In" links in the top black bar smaller and to increase the spacing between them.
2. After comparing the images, it's difficult to definitively verify whether the links are smaller or if the spacing has been increased. The difference, if any, is very subtle.
3. Due to the ambiguity, I cannot confirm that the instruction has been fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
