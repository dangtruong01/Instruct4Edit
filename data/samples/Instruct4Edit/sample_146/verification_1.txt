Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Instruction:** Make the 'MonTix' button in the top right corner slightly larger and give it fully rounded ends, like a pill shape.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modify the 'MonTix' button located in the top right corner. The intended changes are:
    *   Increase its size (specifically, make it "slightly larger").
    *   Change its shape to have "fully rounded ends, like a pill shape".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Size:** Comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, the 'MonTix' button in the 'after' image is visibly taller and wider than in the 'before' image. This demonstrates a clear increase in size, which aligns with "slightly larger."
    *   **Shape:** In the 'before' image, the button has subtly rounded corners, appearing mostly rectangular. In the 'after' image, the horizontal ends of the button are significantly more rounded, forming a distinct semi-circle at each end, which perfectly matches the description of "fully rounded ends, like a pill shape."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. Both aspects of the instruction – the size increase and the transformation to a pill shape with fully rounded ends – are clearly and unequivocally visible and applied in the 'after' image. The visual difference is pronounced and unambiguous.
