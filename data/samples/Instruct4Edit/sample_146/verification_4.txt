Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform three specific text elements below the search bar – 'New support ticket', 'Check ticket status', and the phone number (+33186269517) – from their current plain appearance into distinct, rectangular buttons. Each of these new buttons should have a light background and a small icon.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    -   **Distinct, rectangular buttons:** In the "after" image, the three elements ('New support ticket', 'Check ticket status', and '+33186269517') are indeed styled as distinct, rectangular shapes. In the "before" image, they were simply text links without any button styling. This part of the change is clearly visible and implemented.
    -   **Light background:** The newly styled elements in the "after" image feature a white (light) background, which is distinct from the surrounding page background. This part of the change is clearly visible and implemented.
    -   **Small icon:** Upon close inspection of the "after" image, none of the three rectangular buttons display any small icon. This crucial part of the instruction has not been implemented.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a clear and significant missing element. The instruction explicitly states that *each* button should have "a small icon". However, no icons are present on any of the three styled elements in the "after" image. While the elements have been transformed into rectangular shapes with a light background, the requirement for an icon is entirely unfulfilled.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
