Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for the background behind the main article title, 'How and when do I check in online?', to be given a very light, subtle grey tint. The purpose is to visually separate this section from the surrounding content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The background behind the title 'How and when do I check in online?' is pure white.
    *   **After Image:** Upon careful comparison and even zooming in, the background behind the title 'How and when do I check in online?' remains pure white. There is no discernible grey tint, however light or subtle. The two images appear identical in this specific area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements. The requested change (adding a grey tint to the background of the title) is entirely absent. The background is unchanged and remains white, providing no visual separation as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
