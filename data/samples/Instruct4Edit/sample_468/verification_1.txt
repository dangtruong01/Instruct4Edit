Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color of the navigation links to a lighter shade. This is intended to make the links more visually prominent and easier to read.
2. Visually comparing the two images, the background behind the navigation links at the top of the page in the "after" image appears to be lighter than the "before" image.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The instruction is clear, and the change is visually detectable.

Final verdict:
