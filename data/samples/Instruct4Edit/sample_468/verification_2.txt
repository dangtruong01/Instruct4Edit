Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the vertical space after each team member's block (image and name). This should visually separate them more clearly.
2. Comparing the two images, there appears to be no significant change in the vertical spacing below each team member's information (image, name, title, email link).
3. The spacing between the blocks of each team member looks almost identical in both images.

Final verdict:
