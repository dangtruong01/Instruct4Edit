Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to make the contact information text at the very top of the page "larger" and "easier to read." This primarily implies an increase in font size for the text within the top green bar, which reads "Informazioni tramite sito per email info@xxxx.it o messaggio Whatsapp 371-1390658".

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the font size of the contact information text in the top green bar ("Informazioni tramite sito per email info@xxxx.it o messaggio Whatsapp 371-1390658") appears to be identical. There is no discernible increase in font size. Therefore, the text is not visibly "larger." As there is no size increase, it is difficult to argue it is "easier to read" based on this instruction's primary intent.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The absence of a visual change in font size for the specified text is clear. The instruction was to make it *larger*, which is the most direct way to make it *easier to read* in this context. This change has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
