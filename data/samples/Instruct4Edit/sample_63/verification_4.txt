Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase both the font size and the boldness of the current price displayed on *each* product card. The "current price" is the one that is not struck through.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, for every product card displayed, the current price (e.g., "297,00€", "84,90€", "125,00€", etc.) is visibly larger and significantly bolder in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. This change is consistent across all instances of the current price.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is applied uniformly to all relevant elements. Both font size and boldness have been clearly increased, and there are no instances where the change is missing or only partially applied.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
