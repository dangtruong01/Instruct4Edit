Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the horizontal spacing between the payment method icons located in the footer section of the webpage. This means the icons should appear more spread out from each other.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the payment method icons (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, PayPal, etc.) are positioned relatively close to each other. In the "after" image, the horizontal gap between each of these icons has been significantly increased, making them appear more separated and less clustered.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change precisely matches the instruction. The specified elements (payment method icons), their location (footer), and the type of change (more horizontal space between them) have all been accurately addressed in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
