Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies two changes for the "main navigation links in the menu bar":
    *   They should become bold.
    *   They should become slightly larger in font size.
    Based on the provided images, the main navigation links are identified as the list items under "Categorie" (e.g., "Ricambi Folletto", "Folletto rigenerati", "Usato", etc.).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Boldness:** Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font weight of "Ricambi Folletto", "Folletto rigenerati", and other items listed under "Categorie" appears identical. They do not seem to have been made bold in the "after" image.
    *   **Slightly larger:** Similarly, there is no discernible difference in the font size of these navigation links between the "before" and "after" images. They appear to maintain the same size.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no visual evidence that the instruction was applied. Both the "bold" and "slightly larger" aspects are clearly missing for the identified main navigation links.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
