As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, here is my assessment:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intends to modify the visual appearance of the search input field located in the header. Specifically, it asks for the addition of a subtle border and slightly rounded corners to this field.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon close inspection:
*   **Search Input Field Identification:** The search input field is the text box next to the "Cerca" button in the green header bar.
*   **Subtle Border:** In the "before" image, the search input field appears to have no distinct border, blending almost seamlessly with the white background of the input area. In the "after" image, a very faint, light grey, thin border is visible around the entire search input field. This clearly fits the description of "subtle."
*   **Slightly Rounded Corners:** In the "before" image, the corners of the input field are sharp and 90-degree angles. In the "after" image, the corners are visibly, albeit gently, rounded. This clearly fits the description of "slightly rounded corners."

Both requested changes are present and align with the specified level of subtlety.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. Both aspects of the instruction ("subtle border" and "slightly rounded corners") have been applied to the correct element and are visually discernible, yet not overly prominent, precisely as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
