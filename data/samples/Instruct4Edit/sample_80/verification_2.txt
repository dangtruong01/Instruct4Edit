Here's the visual UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction "Increase the internal spacing around all the text and contact details within the main black and orange content blocks" means that there should be more padding (empty space) between the text content and the inner edges of its containing black and orange background areas. This would make the text appear to move slightly inwards from the current edges of these blocks, providing more breathing room around the content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Black Content Block:** Upon careful comparison, the text content within the black background area (the "LISA MOORE DESIGN" heading, paragraphs, and bullet points) appears to be in the exact same position relative to the overall page layout as in the "before" image. There is no visible increase in internal spacing (padding) around the text from the top, left, or right edges of the black content area. The line height and paragraph spacing also seem identical.
    *   **Orange Content Block:** Similarly, the contact details ("EMAIL", "lisa@lisamooredesign.com", "PHONE", "(+61) 0409 772 583") within the orange block are positioned identically to the "before" image. There is no discernible increase in padding from the top, left, or bottom edges of the orange block. The text remains as close to the edges as it was previously.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was clear about increasing internal spacing around *all* text and contact details within *both* specified blocks. Visually, neither block shows any sign of this change. The "after" image is a pixel-for-pixel identical representation of the "before" image in terms of the content's internal spacing relative to its containers.

**Final verdict:**
