Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that the color of the text 'Email' and 'PHONE' within the orange section should be changed to white.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, the 'Email' and 'PHONE' headings in the orange section are a dark grey/black color.
    *   In the "after" image, the 'Email' and 'PHONE' headings in the orange section remain the same dark grey/black color. There is no visible change to white.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the core change instructed (changing the color to white) is entirely missing. The elements remain their original color.

Final verdict:
