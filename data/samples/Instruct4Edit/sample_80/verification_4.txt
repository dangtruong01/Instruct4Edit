Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to change the bullet points in the list of services from square shapes to circular shapes.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the bullet points for the list "Branding and corporate identity", "Marketing literature", etc., are distinctly square. In the "after" image, these same bullet points have been changed to a circular shape.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, all bullet points in the specified list have been updated as per the instruction. There are no remaining square bullets in that list, and no other bulleted lists are present that might cause ambiguity. The change is consistent and complete.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
