Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Make the text for the navigation links at the top of the page more prominent.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to increase the visual prominence (e.g., make them stand out more, be more noticeable, have greater visual weight) of all text elements within the top navigation ("HOME", "ABOUT", "CONTACT").

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **"HOME":** In both the "before" and "after" images, "HOME" remains a dark grey color. There is no change in its prominence (e.g., no change in color, size, or weight).
    *   **"ABOUT":** In both images, "ABOUT" is a reddish-orange color. There is no change in its prominence.
    *   **"CONTACT":** In the "before" image, "CONTACT" is a dark grey color. In the "after" image, "CONTACT" has changed to a reddish-orange color, matching "ABOUT". This color change *does* make "CONTACT" more prominent than it was previously, as the orange stands out more against the black background than the dark grey.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes. The instruction uses the plural "navigation links," implying that *all* the links should become more prominent. While the "CONTACT" link successfully increased in prominence, the "HOME" link did not change its prominence at all. Therefore, the instruction was not fully applied to all elements it referred to.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
