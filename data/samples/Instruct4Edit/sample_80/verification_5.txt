Here's my review based on your instructions:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the horizontal alignment of the email address "lisa@lisamooredesign.com", which is located at the very bottom of the page. It should be moved from its initial right-aligned position to be horizontally centered.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, "lisa@lisamooredesign.com" is positioned towards the right side of the bottom section of the page. In the "after" image, the same email address has been moved horizontally and is now centered within the visible content area at the bottom.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The specific email address located at the very bottom of the page has been clearly identified and its horizontal alignment has been successfully changed from right-aligned to centered. The instruction was precise and appears to be fully implemented.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
