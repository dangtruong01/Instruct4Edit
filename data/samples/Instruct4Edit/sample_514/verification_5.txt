Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add more padding around the content within each section to make the layout less cramped. This means increasing the spacing between the content and the edges of their containers or sections.
2. Visually comparing the two images, it is difficult to discern any significant changes in padding or spacing within the various sections of the page. While there may be subtle adjustments, they are not readily apparent. The overall "cramped" feeling described in the instruction does not seem to be addressed noticeably.
3. Due to the lack of obvious visual changes, I cannot confidently confirm that the instruction was fully and clearly implemented.

Final verdict:
