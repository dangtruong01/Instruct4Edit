Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding to the footer, specifically above and below the text.
2. Since there is no footer visible in either image, it is impossible to verify the change.
3. The instruction cannot be applied because there is no footer to modify.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
