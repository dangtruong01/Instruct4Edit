Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow under the header "Privacy Policy". This is meant to visually separate the header from the main content.
2. After comparing the two images, I cannot see any difference in the header. Specifically, there's no visible shadow added under the "Privacy Policy" header in the second image.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change simply isn't there.

Final verdict:
