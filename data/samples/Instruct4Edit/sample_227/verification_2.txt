As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I must highlight that the instruction describes an interactive state (a hover effect), which cannot be visually verified using static images. The "before" and "after" images provided are identical and do not display any hover state.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The instruction describes a "hover" effect for "main navigation links" (e.g., "What Is My IP?", "IP Address Lookup").
    *   When the mouse hovers over these links, their background should change to a "light blue color."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   No. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. A hover effect is a dynamic interaction that only appears when a user's mouse pointer is positioned over an element. Static images cannot capture or display a hover state.
    *   Upon comparing the two images pixel by pixel, there are no visual differences between them. Neither image shows any link with a light blue background, as a hover state would not be active by default in a screenshot.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   Yes, a significant doubt arises from the mismatch between the instruction (a dynamic, interactive change) and the provided evidence (static images). It is impossible to verify a hover effect from static screenshots. The images show no change at all, which is expected given the nature of a hover state. To verify this instruction, a video demonstration or an interactive prototype would be required.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (Cannot be verified visually from static images)
