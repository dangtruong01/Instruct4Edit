Here's the review of the visual changes:

### Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the plain text IP address links into visually distinct, interactive elements. Specifically, each IP address range (e.g., "95.108.160.0/24") should:
    *   Be contained within a "pill-shaped" background.
    *   Have a "soft background color".
    *   Appear as a "distinct" element.
    *   Visually suggest it is "clickable".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The IP address ranges are displayed as standard blue, underlined text links, without any background or distinct shape.
    *   **After Image:**
        *   Each IP address range is now enclosed within a light blue-green background.
        *   The corners of these background elements are clearly rounded, giving them a "pill-shaped tag" appearance.
        *   The background color is indeed soft and unobtrusive.
        *   Each range is clearly separated and visually distinct due to its individual background and shape.
        *   While "clickable" is a functional aspect not directly verifiable visually, the transformation from a simple text link to a styled, distinct "tag" strongly implies interactivity and often indicates a clickable element in modern UI design. The visual change fully supports the intent of appearing clickable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no significant doubts or missing elements. The transformation accurately reflects all aspects of the instruction: distinct, pill-shaped, soft background color, and visually suggestive of clickability. The "main content area" where these changes were applied is clearly the section listing the IP ranges.
