Here's the review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the "Facebook" and "Twitter" text links within the footer's "Get In Touch" section into their respective social media brand icons. These icons should also be visually presented as clickable elements.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** In the "Get In Touch" section of the footer, "Facebook" and "Twitter" are present as plain text links.
*   **After Image:** The text links "Facebook" and "Twitter" have been removed. In their place, directly below "Advertising", are two distinct social media brand icons: the Facebook 'f' logo and the Twitter (bird) logo. These icons are clearly visible and replace the original text.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
*   The text links "Facebook" and "Twitter" have been successfully *replaced* by their icons.
*   The icons are the actual social media brand icons.
*   Regarding "making them visually clickable," the icons are presented clearly as standalone elements where links typically reside. While there isn't an explicit visual cue like a button background or hover state shown in a static image, the standard practice of using social media brand icons in a footer implies their interactive nature, and they are distinct enough to suggest clickability. The instruction doesn't specify additional styling beyond being "visually clickable," and the presence of the recognizable icons in place of text links fulfills this.

**Final verdict:**
