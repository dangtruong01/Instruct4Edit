Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle border to be added to the shopping cart section on the right side of the image.
2. By comparing the two images, there is no visible difference to indicate that a border has been added. The shopping cart section appears identical in both images.
3. Since the instruction requested a "subtle" border, it could be argued that it is present but imperceptible. However, a clear visual change should be present to demonstrate the implementation of the instruction.

Final verdict:
