Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to improve the visual appearance of the date selection buttons ("Day", "Week", "Month", "All") so they look more like tabs, and it's easier to tell which one is selected.
2. The "after" image has a distinct visual change compared to the "before" image. The buttons now have a lighter background and a more distinct border. The selected button has a darker background, making it easier to identify.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
