Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the "Log In Or Register An Account" button to be visually smaller and less prominent. This could involve reducing its size, changing its color/contrast, or altering its visual weight in some other way.
2. Comparing the two images, I can't see any difference in the size or prominence of the button. It appears to be exactly the same in both images.
3. There are no apparent changes to the button's appearance.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
