**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to increase the vertical spacing between each individual profile entry within the "Following" list. This means the empty space between "articilization" and "Backlink Store", and between "Backlink Store" and "Medium Staff" should be larger in the "after" image than in the "before" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the vertical space between the individual profile entries (e.g., between the bottom of the 'articilization' entry and the top of the 'Backlink Store' entry) appears to be identical in both images. There is no discernible increase in the vertical spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The visual inspection shows no change in the vertical spacing between the list items. The instruction "Add *more* vertical space" has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
