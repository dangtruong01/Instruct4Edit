**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to visually transform the 'Open in app' text in the upper left corner. This transformation involved two specific visual changes:
    *   Adding a visible outline around the text to make it look more like a button.
    *   Increasing the padding (space) between the text itself and this new outline/button boundary.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon comparing the 'Open in app' text in both the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible visual difference. The text remains as plain text without any added outline or increased padding.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the intended change, but the change itself is entirely missing. The 'Open in app' text in the "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image. Neither a visible outline nor additional padding has been applied.

**Final verdict:**
