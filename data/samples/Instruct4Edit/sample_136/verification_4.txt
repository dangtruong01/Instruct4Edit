Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies reducing the overall size (implying font size and potentially weight/prominence) of the main heading "4 Following" to improve visual hierarchy.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, upon careful comparison, the "4 Following" heading appears to be exactly the same font size and weight in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible reduction in its visual size or prominence.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction was to reduce the size, but the element remains visually identical to its state in the "before" image. The change was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
