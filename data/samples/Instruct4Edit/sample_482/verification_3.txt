Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle border around each image in the main content area.
2. I cannot identify images within the main content area to verify the application of a border.
3. It is unclear if the instruction refers to the small icons next to text elements or if there are other images that I cannot identify.

Final verdict:
