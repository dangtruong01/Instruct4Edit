Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow effect to be added to the article thumbnail boxes. In the images, there is a box around the article "Cos'è il combattimento spirituale?"
2. By comparing the two images, I cannot clearly see any shadow effect added to the article thumbnail box in the "after" image. The box still appears to be a solid, thin line with no shadow.
3. There is no shadow, thus the instruction was not followed.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
