Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the vertical space between the breadcrumb navigation (which is "Home • Articoli taggati 'Francesco di Sales'") and the main content area (which starts with "Tag: Francesco di Sales").
2. Visually comparing the two images, the space between the breadcrumb navigation and the heading "Tag: Francesco di Sales" appears to be visually smaller in the second image.
3. There are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
