Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the font of the tag cloud (the section "Persone che ho nominato...") to a sans-serif font. Sans-serif fonts do not have the small features called "serifs" at the end of strokes.
2. Comparing the two images, the font in the "Persone che ho nominato..." section in the second image (after) is visibly a sans-serif font, whereas the font in the first image (before) has serifs.
3. There are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements.

Final verdict:
