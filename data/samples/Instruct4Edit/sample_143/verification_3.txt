Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the images larger and position them in the horizontal center of the main article content area. The overarching goal is to increase their visual prominence on the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Enlarge the images:** Yes, this is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the two distinct pages were presented as a single, smaller image block. In the "after" image, they are separated into two individual image blocks, and each page is significantly larger and more readable. They now occupy a much greater portion of the available horizontal space.
    *   **Center the images within the main article:** In the "before" image, the single image block was left-aligned within the main content column. In the "after" image, the two enlarged images are now displayed side-by-side, effectively spanning almost the entire width of the main content column. While not centered with large, equal empty margins on either side (as one might expect for a single, smaller centered block), by expanding to fill the available content width, they naturally occupy the central visual space of the article column. They are no longer left-aligned and are clearly positioned centrally in relation to the article's flow. This method of "centering" by filling the available width is common for prominent content.
    *   **Give them more visual prominence:** Yes, due to their increased size and better utilization of the central page space, the images are significantly more prominent and draw the eye more effectively than in the "before" state.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The only potential ambiguity lies in the interpretation of "center." If "centering" strictly implies a block with precise, equal empty space on both the left and right, then this might be seen as "full-width" rather than "centered." However, given the instruction to "enlarge" and provide "more visual prominence," expanding to fill the main content column horizontally is a highly effective way to achieve both, and it inherently positions the content in the most central and prominent way possible within that column, moving it away from its previous left-aligned state. The intent of breaking the left-alignment and making them a focal point in the middle of the page is fully met.
