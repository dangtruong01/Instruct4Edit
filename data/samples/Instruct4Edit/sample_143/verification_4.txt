Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to apply a "soft rounded edge" to all interactive elements that visually resemble buttons or prominent links. The instruction explicitly cited two examples: the "search button" (検索) and the "'蔵書検索' (Library Search)" link in the header. This means these specific elements, which appear to have sharp corners in the "before" image, should display rounded corners in the "after" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, the intended change is not clearly visible for the specified elements.
    *   The "search button" (検索) located next to the input field in the main content area remains with sharp, square corners in both the "before" and "after" images. No rounding has been applied.
    *   The "'蔵書検索' (Library Search)" link in the top right header area also remains with sharp, square corners in both the "before" and "after" images. No rounding has been applied.
    *   Other elements that resemble buttons, such as the large colored buttons ("このサイトについて", "サイトマップ", "アクセシビリティ", "よくある質問") and the smaller footer buttons ("交通アクセス・駐車場", "ページトップへ", "メニュー"), already had rounded corners in the "before" image and show no discernible change in the "after" image. The instruction was to *apply* rounding, implying a change where it was previously absent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the specified elements. The instruction clearly named the "search button" and the "'蔵書検索' (Library Search)" link as examples that should receive rounded edges. Neither of these elements shows any visual change in their corners in the "after" image; they remain square. Therefore, the core of the instruction, as exemplified, has not been implemented.

Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied
