Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing around the main title on the page. This means the space above, below, and to the sides of the main title "Lupine snoeien" should be visually larger in the "after" image.
2. Comparing the two images, it is very difficult to see if there's any difference in spacing around the title. The changes, if any, are negligible.
3. Because I can't definitively confirm the spacing has increased, it's possible the instruction was not fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
