Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to style the table to improve readability, suggesting alternating row colors or borders.
2. The "after" image does include a table with a subtle background color applied to alternating rows, making it easier to distinguish between rows. Borders are also present, but they are faint.
3. The instruction is somewhat vague ("perhaps"), but the design change clearly improves readability through the use of alternating row colors.

Final verdict:
