Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests a more prominent and eye-catching color for the comment submission button.
2. In the "after" image, the comment submission button (labeled "Stakatesten.nl") remains the same color as it was in the "before" image: a standard blue. It has not been changed to a more prominent, eye-catching color.
3. There is no visual difference between the two images regarding the button's color. Therefore, the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
