Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a thin, light grey border around each individual article block within the main content area. The purpose is to make these blocks visually distinct, like "cards."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The main article content (title, metadata, and the first paragraph of the article) is presented directly on the white background without any bounding box or border.
    *   **After Image:** A distinct, thin, light grey border is clearly visible surrounding the entire main article content block (from the title "Technology Enables Business as Usual..." down to the end of the first paragraph of text). This border effectively frames the content, making it appear as a separate card on the page. The elements below this block (author photo, bio, and badges) remain without borders, which aligns with the instruction focusing on "article blocks."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is very clear and precise. The border is present, it's thin, it's light grey, and it encompasses the primary article content, fulfilling the "distinct card" appearance for the "article block" displayed. While the instruction mentions "each individual article block" (plural), only one is visible in these single-article view screenshots, and it has been correctly bordered.

**Final verdict:**
