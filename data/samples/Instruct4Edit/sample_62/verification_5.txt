**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to increase the size of social media icons located in the footer section of the page and change their color to be brighter, aiming to make them more attention-grabbing.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Upon comparing both the "before" and "after" images, no social media icons are present in the footer area (or anywhere else on the page). Both images are visually identical.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the primary elements (social media icons) that were instructed to be modified are entirely absent from both the original and the modified designs provided. As such, the instruction could not have been implemented visually.

**Final verdict:**
