Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the links on the left sidebar more visually distinct, by using different font, color or background color on hover.
2. Comparing the two images, there are no visible changes to the links on the left sidebar. The font, color, and background do not appear to have changed.
3. There are no visible changes, leading to uncertainty of the instruction being implemented.

Final verdict:
