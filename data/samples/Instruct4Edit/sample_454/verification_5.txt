Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the "Useful Words" section visually stand out more. This could be achieved through a background color or a more prominent heading style.
2. Comparing the two images, the "Useful Words" section appears to be visually identical in both images. There's no background color added and no changes to the heading style.
3. There's no visible change in the after image.

Final verdict:
