Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to make two specific elements:
    *   The author's name ("Terra Banks PM")
    *   The 'My Stories' section heading ("My Stories")
    ...larger and bolder, so they "stand out more."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Author's name ("Terra Banks PM"):** Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the text "Terra Banks PM" appears to be exactly the same size and font-weight in both. There is no discernible increase in size or boldness.
    *   **'My Stories' section heading ("My Stories"):** Similarly, the text "My Stories" (the section heading) also appears identical in size and font-weight in both images. It has not been made larger or bolder.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no visible changes to either of the specified elements. Both the author's name and the 'My Stories' section heading remain unchanged in terms of size and boldness in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. The instruction has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
