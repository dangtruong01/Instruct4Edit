As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the two images provided.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction mandates applying a "subtle rounding to the corners of all input fields and buttons on the page" to achieve a "uniform, modern look." This means I should look for a softening of the sharp, 90-degree corners on form elements and interactive buttons.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    I have carefully examined the following elements in both images:
    *   **Input field "Author":** The corners remain sharp in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no visible rounding.
    *   **Button "Follow":** The corners remain sharp in both images. No rounding is evident.
    *   **Input field (Search):** The corners appear identical and sharp in both images.
    *   **Input fields next to "Sort":** Both small input fields show sharp corners in both images, with no discernible change.
    *   **Dropdown "Category":** The corners of this select element also appear sharp and unchanged in both images.

    No discernible visual difference regarding corner rounding on any identified input fields or buttons can be observed between the "before" and "after" images. The elements appear to be exactly the same in terms of their corner treatment.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    My primary doubt is that the "after" image appears to be identical to the "before" image concerning the instruction given. There is no visual evidence that any rounding has been applied to any of the specified elements.

**Final verdict:**
