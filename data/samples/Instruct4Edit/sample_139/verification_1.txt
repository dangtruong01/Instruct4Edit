Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific changes to the main site title "たこ焼き生地 余り 保存" located at the top left of the page:
    *   Increase its font size significantly ("much larger").
    *   Change its color to a distinct and easily visible blue ("noticeable blue").
    It also implicitly confirms the target element's location as "at the top left".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Size:** In the "before" image, "たこ焼き生地 余り 保存" at the very top is a standard, relatively small font size, similar to the surrounding navigation links. In the "after" image, this same title is visibly and significantly larger, making it stand out as requested.
    *   **Color:** In the "before" image, the title is black or a very dark grey. In the "after" image, its color has clearly been changed to a distinct shade of blue, which is noticeable.
    *   **Position:** While the "before" image shows the title centered at the top, the "after" image shows it moved to the top *left*, aligning with the instruction's reference "at the top left of the page". This extra adjustment (from centered to left-aligned) wasn't explicitly asked for as a *change* in position, but the final state perfectly matches the specified location.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, all aspects of the instruction (target element, size, color, and location) have been clearly and fully implemented in the "after" image. The changes are unambiguous and visually evident.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
