Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Increase the vertical spacing between lines of text throughout the main article content to make it easier to read.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the `line-height` (vertical distance between baselines of consecutive lines of text) specifically within the primary textual content of the article. This should visually make the paragraphs appear less dense and more open, thereby improving readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the paragraphs of text in the "after" image exhibit noticeably increased vertical spacing between lines. This makes the text blocks appear more open and less cramped, aligning with the goal of improving readability. This change is consistent across all the main article paragraphs.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Scope:** The instruction specifies "throughout the main article content". The increased line spacing is indeed applied consistently to all paragraphs that constitute the main body of the article.
    *   **Over-application (not a doubt about fulfillment):** While not explicitly requested, the increased line spacing also appears to have been applied to the list of links in the footer section at the bottom of the page. This is an over-application relative to the "main article content" instruction, but it does not negate the fact that the instruction *was* fully and clearly applied to the *intended* target (the main article content). The instruction did not state "only" apply to main article content.
    *   No part of the main article content appears to have been missed.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
