Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to increase the space (breathing room) around the individual menu items in the top right navigation bar. This typically translates to adding more horizontal spacing between the text links.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the horizontal distance between the menu items ("About", "Blog", "Contact Us", "たこ焼き生地 余り保存") in the top right navigation bar is noticeably wider compared to the "before" image. This increased spacing effectively provides more "breathing room" as requested.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is precisely where it was instructed (top right navigation bar), and the nature of the change (increased spacing/breathing room) is evident.
