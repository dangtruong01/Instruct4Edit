**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform a specific long list of related links, located at the bottom of the page, from a single vertical stack into a multi-column layout. The goal is likely to make the list more compact and easier to scan horizontally.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the list of links (starting with items like "星川昭峰", "国際線", "国際興業", etc., near the very bottom of the main content area) is displayed as a single, long, vertical column, where each link typically occupies its own line.
    *   In the "after" image, the exact same list of links is now organized into multiple columns (visually appearing as 3 columns for much of the list). The content flows horizontally across these columns before wrapping down to the next "row" of links. This significantly reduces the vertical space occupied by the list.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The specific element targeted by the instruction (the long list of links at the bottom) is clearly identifiable in both images. Its original "single vertical stack" layout is evident in the "before" image, and its transformed "multi-column layout" is unequivocally present in the "after" image. The change fully matches the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
