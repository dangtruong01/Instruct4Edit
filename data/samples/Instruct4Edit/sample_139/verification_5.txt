Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Center the copyright information at the very bottom of the page.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The text "© たき屋焼き生地祭り 2020", located at the very bottom of the page, should shift from its original left-aligned position to be horizontally centered within the page's content area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, in the "before" image, the copyright information is clearly aligned to the left. In the "after" image, the same copyright information is visibly centered horizontally on the page. The text itself and its vertical position (at the very bottom) remain consistent, confirming only the horizontal alignment has changed as instructed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is clear, unambiguous, and fully implemented as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
