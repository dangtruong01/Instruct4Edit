Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for three changes: a light gray background for the search input, a darker gray for the search icon, and a wider input box when focused. Unfortunately, neither image contains a search input in the header, nor a search icon.
2. Since there is no search input to modify, none of the instructed changes are visible in the "after" image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instructions, but it appears there is no search input in either of the designs.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
