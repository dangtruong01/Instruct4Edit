Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires vertical centering of the logo and the "Create your own podcast" button within the header.
2. In the "after" image, it is not possible to verify this instruction as the header is not visible in the provided image. The top is cut off.
3. Without seeing the header area in the modified image, it's impossible to assess if the vertical alignment was implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
