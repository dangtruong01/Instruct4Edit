Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to remove the fade-in effect when hovering over a menu item that has a submenu. The submenu should appear instantly.
2. It's impossible to determine if the change was implemented from static images. I would need to interact with the UI to confirm this.
3. Because I can't confirm the change visually, it is ambiguous.

Final verdict:
