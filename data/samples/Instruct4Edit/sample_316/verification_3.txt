Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to left-align the text content within the main table. By visually inspecting the "before" image, text appears to be left-aligned by default, not centered.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no visible change in the text alignment.
3. The instruction is slightly misleading because the initial text alignment seems to be left-aligned already.

Final verdict:
