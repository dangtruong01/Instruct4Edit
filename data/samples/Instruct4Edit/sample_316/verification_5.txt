Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests that the input fields in the search form become wider and have a subtle border added around them.
2. Comparing the two images, the input fields don't appear noticeably wider. There's no clearly visible border around the input fields in the 'after' image.
3. The changes are not clearly visible, if at all.

Final verdict:
