Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to modernize the logo at the top left. This implies a change in the visual appearance of the logo itself.
2. Comparing the two images, the logo at the top left ("Jusqu'Aux Dents") remains visually unchanged. The font, layout, and overall style are the same in both images.
3. There is no visible difference in the logo between the "before" and "after" images.

Final verdict:
