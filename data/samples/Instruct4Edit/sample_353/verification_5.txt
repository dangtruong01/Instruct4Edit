Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to replace the horizontal lines separating the different sections/fields with a more subtle visual separator such as spacing or a light border. The goal is to declutter the page and improve visual appeal.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the horizontal lines appear to remain unchanged in the modified image.
3. There are no visual changes regarding the horizontal lines. They are still present.

Final verdict:
