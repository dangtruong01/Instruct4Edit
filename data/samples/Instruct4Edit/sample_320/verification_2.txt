Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to widen both the main content area and the sidebar. This means the text in those areas should occupy a larger horizontal space.
2. By comparing the two images, it is clear that the main content area (left side) and the sidebar (right side) are indeed wider in the "after" image. The text spans a greater horizontal distance.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
