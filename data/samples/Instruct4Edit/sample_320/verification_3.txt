Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle background color to the sidebar. This means the area on the right-hand side of the page should have a light color, different from the white background of the main content.
2. By comparing the two images, I can see that the right sidebar (with "About Me" and "Previous Posts") does not have any background color in either image. Both the before and after images have a white background for both the main content and the sidebar.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction. The instruction clearly asks for a background color change in the sidebar, but it is missing in the after image.

Final verdict:
