Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires adding visual separation between the "previous posts" in the sidebar. This could be done with lines, increased spacing, or other visual cues.
2. In the "after" image, faint horizontal lines have been added between each "previous post" title in the sidebar. This creates visual separation.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The lines are thin but visible enough to fulfill the instruction.

Final verdict:
