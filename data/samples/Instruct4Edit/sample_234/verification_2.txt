Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests an increase in the horizontal spacing (the gap) between the individual items within the main navigation menu. The main navigation menu items are the black-background buttons labeled "AEG", "ASKO", "Bosch oppvaskmaskin", "Electrolux", "GRAM", "Miele", "Siemens oppvaskmaskin", "Test", and "Whirlpool" located below the header.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. A direct comparison of the "before" and "after" images shows that the horizontal spacing between all of the main navigation menu items remains exactly the same. The items are positioned identically relative to each other in both versions. For example, the distance between "AEG" and "ASKO", or "Test" and "Whirlpool", has not increased.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The spacing between the menu items is definitively unchanged. The instruction was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
