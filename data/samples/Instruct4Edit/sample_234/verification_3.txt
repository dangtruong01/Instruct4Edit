Here's the review of the visual changes:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to simplify and lighten the visual separation between articles. Specifically, it requires replacing the existing double horizontal lines (which appear under "Mer info om/kjøp..." and above "Skrevet i...") with a single, less prominent, and lighter-colored horizontal line.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible and consistently applied.
    *   In the "before" image, at the bottom of each article (e.g., below "Mer info om/kjøp Siemens SK25E202EU"), there are two horizontal lines: a thinner, lighter one on top, and a thicker, darker one directly below it.
    *   In the "after" image, these double lines are gone. In their place, there is a single, very faint and thin horizontal line. This new line is significantly lighter in color than both original lines.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction requested a "single, lighter separator" to replace "double horizontal lines," and this has been precisely achieved. The old lines are completely gone, and the new single line is undeniably lighter and less visually heavy. The change is applied uniformly to all article separators.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
