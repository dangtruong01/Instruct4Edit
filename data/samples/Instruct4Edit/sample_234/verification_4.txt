Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to apply a light background color specifically to the entire right-hand sidebar section. The purpose of this change is to make the sidebar visually stand out and be clearly distinct from the main content area of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** In the "before" image, the right-hand sidebar (which contains sections like "HER KJØPER DU", "Whirlpool", "Electrolux", etc.) has the same white background color as the central main content area. There is no visual separation or distinction between these two sections based on background color.
    *   **After Image:** In the "after" image, the right-hand sidebar now clearly features a light grey background color. This background color covers the entire content area of the sidebar, from its top boundary ("HER KJØPER DU") down to its bottom ("Hvitvarepriser på nett"). This light grey color effectively differentiates the sidebar from the white background of the main content area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The term "entire right-hand sidebar section" appears to be fully covered by the new background.
    *   The chosen color is indeed a "light background color" (a light grey).
    *   The change successfully "visually distinguishes it from the main content" by creating a clear color contrast.
    There are no apparent doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements; the instruction has been implemented precisely as described.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
