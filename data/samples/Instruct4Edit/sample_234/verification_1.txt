Here's my review based on the provided images:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the font size and overall visual prominence of the main site title text, making it stand out more to the user.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the main site title "Oppvaskmaskin" is present but relatively small. In the "after" image, the text "Oppvaskmaskin" is significantly larger in font size, making it much more prominent and drawing the eye. Its increased size directly contributes to its visual dominance.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is clearly and unequivocally applied. The main site title "Oppvaskmaskin" is distinctly larger and, as a direct result, more visually dominant in the "after" image. No other text was mistaken for the main site title, and the change is effective in fulfilling the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
