Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the font of the accordion titles in the sidebar to a cleaner and more modern font.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is a subtle change in the font used for the accordion titles in the sidebar. The "after" image appears to have a slightly different font that could be described as cleaner and more modern.
3. The change is subtle, and without knowing the specific font intended, it's difficult to definitively say if the change is exactly as desired, but a font change has clearly been applied.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
