Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a "subtle, light gray background" for the navigation bar to visually distinguish it.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernible change in the background color of the navigation bar. It remains the same white color in both images.
3. The instruction wasn't implemented.

Final verdict:
