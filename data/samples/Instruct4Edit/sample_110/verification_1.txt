Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the site name in the header bigger and bolder. The site name is "MultiWingSpan".
2. Comparing the two images, "MultiWingSpan" at the top of the page does not appear bigger or bolder in the second (modified) image.
3. There is no visible change in the font size or weight of the site name.

Final verdict:
