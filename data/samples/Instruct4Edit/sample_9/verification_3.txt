Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to add a "subtle shadow" to the image in the first section. It's unclear which "image" is referred to, but it's most likely the main image/banner at the top of the "Events" section.

2.  **Visibility:** The "Events" section's main image (the one with the sale banner and map) appears unchanged. There is no added shadow.

3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The instruction is clear about adding a shadow, but unclear as to which of the images should receive the shadow. However, the change, whatever it was intended to be, is not visible.

**Final Verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
