Here's my assessment:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Change the background color of the "Our services" and "Get a quote" buttons.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the background colors have been changed. The "Our Services" button now has a red background, and the "Get a quote" button has a green background, while the original image had them with a blue background.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

Final verdict:
