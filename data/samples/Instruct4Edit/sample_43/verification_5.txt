Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to reduce the size of the text within the footer.
2.  **Visibility:** The footer text in the modified image appears negligibly different in size compared to the original. The difference is not clearly visible.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The change, if any, is too subtle to be certain about its implementation.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
