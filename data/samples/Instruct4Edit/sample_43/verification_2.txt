Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to darken the color of the text in the navigation bar (Home, About, Services, etc.).
2. In the "After" image, the navigation bar text color appears to be the same as the "Before" image. There is no visual indication that the text color has changed.
3. The instruction was to change the color to a darker shade, but there is no discernible change in the navigation text color.

Final verdict:
