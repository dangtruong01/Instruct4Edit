Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Round the corners of the "RESPONDER" (Reply) buttons.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the shape of the buttons appear identical in both images.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The corners of the "RESPONDER" button in the "after" image are not rounded.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
