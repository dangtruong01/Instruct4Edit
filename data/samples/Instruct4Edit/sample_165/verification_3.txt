Step-by-step justification:
1.  The intended visual change is to make the text in the article headers bolder. The article header is the title of the forum thread.
2.  The "after" image appears to have the same level of boldness as the "before" image.
3.  The text appears unchanged.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
