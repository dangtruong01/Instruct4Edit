Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the "Privacy Policy | Cookie settings" box at the bottom.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot visually detect any shadow added to the "Privacy Policy | Cookie settings" box in the second image. The box looks identical in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself. The term "subtle shadow" is subjective, but I would still expect to see *some* shadow.

Final verdict:
