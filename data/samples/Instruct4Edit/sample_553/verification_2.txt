Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the border of the "Popular Searches" list items softer (less defined), thinner, and a lighter shade of grey.
2. Upon close inspection, there's no visible difference in the border's thickness, color, or definition between the "before" and "after" images. The borders of the "Popular Searches" list items appear identical in both images.
3. There's no ambiguity in the instruction, but the change is not visible in the provided images.

Final verdict:
