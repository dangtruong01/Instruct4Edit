Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to increase the font size of the main heading, which is "casino en ligne argent réelle".
2.  **Visibility of Change:** The font size of the main heading appears unchanged between the "before" and "after" images.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The font size of the main heading does not appear to have changed.

**Final Verdict: ❌ Not Applied**
