Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is the addition of a subtle drop shadow to the article boxes. Article boxes would be the containers of each article.
2. I see no difference in the appearance of the article boxes in the "after" image.
3. The absence of a drop shadow suggests the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
