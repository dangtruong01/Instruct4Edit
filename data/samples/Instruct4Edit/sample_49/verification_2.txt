Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to make the navigation menu at the top of the page "sticky" or fixed. This means the menu should remain visible at the top of the screen even when the user scrolls down.

2.  **Visibility of Change:** No visual change is detectable in the two images. The menu remains in the same position relative to the rest of the content in both images.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The core requirement of making the menu sticky is not visible in either of the images. We would need to see the page scrolled to verify the change, but the static images do not give us that ability.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
