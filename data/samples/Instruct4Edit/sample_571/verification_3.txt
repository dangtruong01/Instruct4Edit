Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the navigation items ("Stay", "Dine", "Explore", etc.) in the header. This means there should be more horizontal space between each of these words.
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the navigation items in the header ("Stay", "Dine", "Explore", "Meet", "Celebrate", "Holidays") appears to be visually identical. I don't see any increased spacing in the "after" image.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction was not followed, as I don't see any change.

Final verdict:
