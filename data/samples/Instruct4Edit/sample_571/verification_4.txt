Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the size of the hotel logo located in the footer.
2. I cannot see the footer in either image, hence I cannot assess if the logo size has changed.
3. I cannot determine if the instruction has been implemented as the footer is not displayed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
