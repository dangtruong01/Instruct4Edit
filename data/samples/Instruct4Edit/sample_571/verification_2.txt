Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the header to make it appear elevated.
2. I cannot see any difference between the two images, including the header section. No shadow is apparent.
3. I cannot be certain that the change was applied, or that it is visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
