❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the color of the footer links to a lighter, more readable color.
2. I cannot locate the footer or any footer links in either image.
3. It's possible the footer is located below the shown content, or the instruction is ambiguous/faulty.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
