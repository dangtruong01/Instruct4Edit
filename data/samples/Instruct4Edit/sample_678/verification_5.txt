Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make all clickable text, particularly those in categorized lists, visually distinct as links and easier to read. This typically involves adding conventional link styling such as underlines and/or changing the text color (commonly blue) to improve their affordance and visual scan-ability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible throughout the entire interface.
    *   **Consistent Styling:** In the "after" image, almost all text elements that are logically clickable (e.g., navigation paths, list items, references to other pages/data) have been uniformly updated to a blue color *and* are underlined.
    *   **Before vs. After Examples:**
        *   **Top Path ("Cesta"):** "OMA" was blue, now it's blue and underlined.
        *   **Address Details:** "Partizánska dolina" and "Kremnica" were plain text, now they are blue and underlined.
        *   **Bottom Navigation:** All elements like "Stredné Slovensko", "Banskobystrický kraj", "Kremnica", etc., were black text, now they are all blue and underlined.
        *   **Categorized Lists (e.g., "Turistika v okolí", "Cyklotrasy v okolí", "V kategóriách"):** All entries within these sections, which were previously plain black text, are now consistently blue and underlined. This directly addresses the "especially within the categorized lists" part of the instruction.
        *   **Tabs/Sections (e.g., "Turistika", "Šport", "Príroda", and their sub-items like "Chata na Skalke", "Skalka - Južný okruh"):** Both the section titles and their list contents are now blue and underlined, making them clearly identifiable as links.
        *   **Footer/Information Sections ("Viac o bode", "Viac o nás", "Podpor projekt OMA", "Zdroj dát"):** Many items in these sections were previously blue but *not* underlined (e.g., "aktualizovať mapu", "twitteri", "facebooku", "OpenStreetMap.org"). Now, all these are blue *and* underlined. Some previously black text items are now also blue and underlined (e.g., "MHD" in "Viac o bode", "v správach" in "Viac o nás", "CC" in "Zdroj dát").

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the implementation appears to be thorough and consistent across the entire page. The instruction was followed comprehensively by applying the clear blue and underline styling to all identifiable clickable text elements. This significantly improves their clarity as links and, by extension, their interactive legibility.

**Final verdict:**
