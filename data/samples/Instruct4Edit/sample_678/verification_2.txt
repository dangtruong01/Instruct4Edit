Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to "soften the appearance of all the individual content boxes" by "reducing their background gradient" and "toning down their shadow" to ultimately "create a cleaner look." This implies making the boxes less visually prominent or less "popping out" from the background.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **Background Gradient:** In the "before" image, many of the distinct content boxes (e.g., "Via Ferrata Skalka" title, "Turistika", "Zastávky v okolí", "V kategóriách", "Viac o bode", etc.) exhibit a very subtle vertical background gradient, making them appear slightly rounded or volumetric. In the "after" image, this subtle gradient has been removed, resulting in a flat, uniform background color for these boxes.
    *   **Shadow:** Similarly, the "before" image shows a very faint drop shadow beneath these same content boxes, which gives them a subtle lifted effect. In the "after" image, these shadows are either completely removed or significantly reduced to the point of being imperceptible, contributing to a flatter, cleaner appearance.
    *   **Overall Cleaner Look:** The combination of removing the gradient and toning down/removing the shadow successfully makes the boxes appear less pronounced and integrated more smoothly with the page background, thus creating a visibly cleaner and softer look.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction asked for "reducing" the gradient and "toning down" the shadow. While the result appears to be a complete removal of these effects, this fulfills the spirit of the instruction by achieving the intended "softer" and "cleaner" look through the most extreme form of reduction/toning down. All identified "individual content boxes" throughout the page that displayed these effects in the "before" image have been consistently modified in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
