**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for a re-arrangement of various information boxes (e.g., "Ubytovanie", "Stravovanie") from their original layout into a more organized, potentially multi-column, structure. The goal is to improve the overall flow of content, implying a more compact and scannable layout, reducing excessive vertical space and utilizing horizontal space better.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the information boxes like "Ubytovanie", "Stravovanie", "Turistika", "Šport", etc., are arranged in a somewhat loose, predominantly single-column fashion, with some boxes awkwardly wrapping or leaving significant empty space.
    *   In the "after" image, a large section of these information boxes (including "Ubytovanie", "Stravovanie", "Turistika", "Šport", "Príroda", "Zima", "Prevádzkovateľ", "Zastávky v okolí", "Ulice v okolí", "Turistika v okolí", "Cyklotrasy v okolí") has been re-organized into a distinct multi-column grid. This main section appears to be a four-column layout, where boxes are tightly packed horizontally before flowing to the next row.
    *   Additionally, the "V kategóriách" box, which was a long single block, now visually spans across the new multi-column layout, confirming its inclusion in the new grid structure.
    *   Further down, the "Viac info" and "Viac o nás" sections (which replaced/modified "Podpor projekt OMA" and "Viac o nás" from the original) are also clearly arranged in a two-column layout, demonstrating consistent application of the multi-column principle to other information blocks.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction used "perhaps multi-column," and the design has definitively implemented a multi-column layout, which fully satisfies the suggestion.
    *   The instruction provided "Ubytovanie" and "Stravovanie" as examples. The "after" image has applied the multi-column organization to a much wider range of information boxes, which meets and exceeds the requirement.
    *   The "after" image includes a new descriptive text at the very top explaining the design changes. While this text itself is not part of the visual arrangement of the content boxes, it confirms the intent of the change. For the purpose of assessing the visual implementation of the instruction, this text can be disregarded.
    *   The "Podpor projekt OMA" box from the "before" image has been replaced and integrated into a new multi-column arrangement ("Viac info" and "Viac o nás"). This is a modification of both content and layout, but the resulting layout for the information boxes aligns with the instruction's intent to organize content into columns.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
