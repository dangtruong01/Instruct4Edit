As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, here is my analysis:

**Instruction:** Give the currently active tab within the information boxes a more prominent visual highlight.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the "currently active tab" visually more distinct and prominent. In the "before" image, the "Cities" tab is visually active due to its light gray background. Therefore, the intended change is to enhance the highlight of this specific "Cities" tab.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **For "Cities":** In the "after" image, the "Cities" tab retains its light gray background and additionally gains a blue underline. This blue underline *does* make it more prominent compared to just the gray background, fulfilling the "more prominent visual highlight" aspect for this specific tab.
    *   **For "Plans", "Legal", and "Publications":** In the "before" image, these were merely section headers without any indication of being "active tabs" (they did not have the light gray background that "Cities" had). In the "after" image, a blue underline has also been added to "Plans", "Legal", and "Publications". While this is a form of highlight, these elements were *not* "currently active tabs" in the original context as defined by the visual cues present. The instruction specifically referred to "the *currently active* tab" (singular), implying a single element that was already active.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant ambiguities and an over-application.
    The instruction was precise: "Give *the currently active tab*... a more prominent visual highlight." In the "before" state, "Cities" was the only visually "active tab." While "Cities" *did* receive a more prominent highlight, the identical highlight (blue underline) was also applied to "Plans," "Legal," and "Publications." These elements were not "currently active tabs" in the "before" image; they were just section headers. Applying the highlight to them implies a broader interpretation of "active tab" or an unrequested design change. This makes the implementation inconsistent with the strict wording of the instruction, which focused on "the" (singular) "currently active" element.

**Final verdict:**
