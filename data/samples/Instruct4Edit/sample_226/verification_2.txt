**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to reduce the overall size of the logo image located in the page header (the blue icon in the top-left corner).
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, upon close comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the blue logo image in the header appears to be precisely the same size in both versions. There is no discernible reduction in its dimensions.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts; the logo's size remains unchanged visually. The instruction has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
