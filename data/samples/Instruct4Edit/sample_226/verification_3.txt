Here's the step-by-step justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to modify the appearance of social media icons. Specifically, they should no longer display their distinct brand colors (e.g., Facebook blue, Twitter blue/black) but instead adopt a single, uniform neutral color (like gray, white, or black) across all of them.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** There are two "Follow" buttons. The first one is a distinct blue color (strongly resembling Facebook's brand color). The second one is black.
*   **After Image:** Both "Follow" buttons have been changed to a consistent shade of gray.

This change is clearly visible. The blue button is no longer blue, and the black button is no longer black. Both have adopted the same neutral gray color.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. While these are "Follow" buttons rather than traditional small social media *icons*, their initial brand-like coloring (especially the blue one) and function ("Follow") strongly suggest they are the intended targets of the instruction. The change to a consistent neutral color has been fully implemented for these elements. There are no other social media icons or elements on the page that contradict this change or have been missed.

**Final verdict:**
