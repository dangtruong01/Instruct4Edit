Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Center the main 'English River Watershed' title horizontally on the page.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to move the "English River Watershed" title from its current left-aligned position to a horizontally centered position relative to the page width.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the 'English River Watershed' title remains in the exact same left-aligned position in both instances. There has been no horizontal movement or centering applied to the title.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The title's horizontal position has not changed whatsoever. The instruction to center it has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
