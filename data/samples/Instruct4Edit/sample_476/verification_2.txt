Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies changing the font of the "site title in the header" to a bolder, more prominent typeface.
2. Looking at both images, I can not locate the site title in the header.
3. The instruction is ambiguous as it assumes the presence of a site title in the header, which I cannot visually confirm.

Final verdict:
