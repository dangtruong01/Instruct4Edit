Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the main navigation bar fill the entire width of the screen. Visually, this means the bar at the very top of the page should extend to the left and right edges of the screen.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible difference in the width of the main navigation bar. It does not fill the entire width of the screen in either image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible in the after image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
