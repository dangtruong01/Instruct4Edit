1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the "Related Articles" images and their corresponding titles.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there's no discernible difference in the spacing between the images and titles in the "Related Articles" section. The layout and spacing appear identical.
3. There's no ambiguity in the instruction, but the change is not visible in the provided images.
