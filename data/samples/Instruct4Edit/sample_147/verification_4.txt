**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical distance (spacing) both above and below the "For More Information" contact form section. The purpose is to provide more visual separation and "breathing room" for this specific content block.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Spacing Above:** In the "before" image, the "For More Information" heading appears quite close to the "Disclaimer" paragraph above it. In the "after" image, there is a clear and visible increase in the vertical space between the "Disclaimer" paragraph and the "For More Information" heading.
    *   **Spacing Below:** In the "before" image, the bottom of the form fields (specifically the last row of input boxes like "Email*") are very close to the top edge of the grey footer bar. In the "after" image, a substantial amount of vertical space has been added between the bottom of the form fields and the grey footer bar, making the separation very distinct.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the changes are clear and unambiguously address both parts of the instruction ("above and below"). The added space effectively provides the requested "more breathing room."

**Final verdict:**
