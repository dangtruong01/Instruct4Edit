**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the background color of the main navigation bar (the box containing links like "Home," "About Us," etc., located at the top-left) from its current light grey/white to a dark blue color. This dark blue should specifically match the existing dark blue background color of the footer section at the bottom of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The main navigation bar at the top-left has a light grey background. The footer at the bottom has a distinct dark blue background.
    *   **After Image:** The main navigation bar's background has been changed to a dark blue. This dark blue visually appears to be the identical shade of blue as the footer's background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The "main navigation bar" is clearly identifiable.
    *   Its background color has changed from light to dark blue.
    *   The new dark blue color perfectly matches the dark blue of the footer, as instructed.
    *   There are no other elements that could be ambiguously considered part of the "main navigation bar" whose background color was missed. The dropdown "Select Page" is a separate element and its background was not specified for change, nor is it typically considered part of a "navigation bar" in the same way the block of links is.
