Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction is to move the footer text (which is located at the bottom of the page) closer to the bottom of the footer section. The footer is the area at the very bottom of the image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the footer text has been moved towards the very bottom of the page, so it is closer to the bottom edge.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
