Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Increase the size of the logo image.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The logo appears to be the same size in both images.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the logo size is the same.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
