Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is a subtle border added to the bottom of the header section.
2. The after image doesn't display any visual changes in the header region. There is no subtle border added.
3. There are no doubts; the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
