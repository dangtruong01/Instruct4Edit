Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that the currently selected item in the main menu bar (which appears to be "Local" based on its bold styling) should have a *distinct background color* to highlight it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The "Local" menu item is bold, but it does not have any distinct background color; its background is the same as the rest of the page and the other menu items (white).
    *   **After Image:** The "Local" menu item is still bold, but there is *no change* in its background color. It remains white, identical to the "before" image and the other menu items. No distinct background color has been applied.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no change visible regarding the background color of the selected menu item. The instruction specifically asked for a "distinct background color," which is clearly missing in the "after" image. The only highlighting present (bold text) was already there in the "before" image and does not involve a background color.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
