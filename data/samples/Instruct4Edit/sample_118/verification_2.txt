**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction was to increase the font size of the main heading of the news article ("Un atropello, permitir que se habite la Villa Panamericana") to make it significantly larger.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, there is no discernible change in the font size of the main heading. Upon careful comparison, the text appears to be exactly the same size in both the "before" and "after" images.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts. The instruction to increase the font size of the main heading was not implemented at all.

**Final verdict:**
