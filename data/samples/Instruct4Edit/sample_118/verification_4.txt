**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to change the color of the 'Buscar' button, located next to the search box in the bottom right column, to a more noticeable blue.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In the "before" image, the 'Buscar' button is a light grey. In the "after" image, the 'Buscar' button has been changed to a distinct, darker blue color. This blue is clearly more noticeable than the original grey.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The specific button was correctly identified, and its color was changed to a blue that is indeed more noticeable, fulfilling the instruction's criteria.

**Final verdict:**
