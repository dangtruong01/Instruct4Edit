Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to move a "main site logo" in the header to a higher position. This should result in increased vertical space between this logo and the "primary navigation" (presumably the "Local", "Si las Fotos Hablan", etc. links).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible.
    *   There is no discernible "main site logo" (graphic or prominent text) present in the header of either the "before" or "after" image. The header primarily contains utility links ("Contacto", "Directorio", "Aviso de Privacidad") and then the main navigation links ("Local", "Si las Fotos Hablan", "Videos", "Otras ediciones").
    *   Comparing the two images, the entire header section, including all text links and their vertical spacing, appears identical. No elements have shifted upwards, and no vertical space has been introduced or increased between any elements in the header and the primary navigation.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Ambiguity 1:** The primary ambiguity is the absence of a clearly identifiable "main site logo" in the provided visuals. If the logo is not present, the instruction regarding its positioning cannot be visually verified as applied.
    *   **Ambiguity 2:** Even if one were to interpret "main site logo" as a placeholder for a future element or a general instruction for the header area, no vertical adjustment of *any* existing elements (e.g., the top utility links or the primary navigation links) has occurred to suggest an attempt at creating more vertical space or repositioning. The header is pixel-perfect identical in both images.
