**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to change the color of social media icons located at the very bottom of the page to a lighter, more visible hue.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Upon reviewing both the "before" and "after" images, there are no social media icons visible at the very bottom of the page (in the footer area or anywhere else) in either image. Therefore, no color change can be observed for these specified elements.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the primary elements the instruction refers to (social media icons) are completely absent from both images. It is impossible to verify the application of the instruction if the target elements do not exist in the provided visuals.

**Final verdict:**
