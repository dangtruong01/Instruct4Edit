❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The "Рубрики новостей" (News Categories) sidebar, located on the left side of the page, should be hidden.
2.  **Visibility of change:** Both images appear identical. The "Рубрики новостей" sidebar is present in both the "before" and "after" images, making the requested change not visible.
3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities/Missing elements:** The instruction specifies hiding the sidebar on "smaller screens". However, there is no way to determine if these images are representative of a "smaller screen" or what the intended implementation of the change is on any given screen size. The requested change is not visible in the provided image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
