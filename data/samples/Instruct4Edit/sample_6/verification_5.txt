❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to hide the sidebar on smaller screens.
2. There is no visual difference between the two images, so we cannot confirm the sidebar is hidden on smaller screens. The instruction requires a responsive change, which cannot be judged with single static images.
3. We cannot determine the absence of the sidebar, as the same page elements are present.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
