Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The logo should be smaller.
    *   The logo should be positioned on the left side of the header.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   The logo appears to be of the same size in both images.
    *   The logo position is unchanged in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction to change the size of the logo and position it on the left is not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
