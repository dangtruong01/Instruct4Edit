Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the vertical space between the title of the post ("Montaža samonosnih vrat in ograjnih elementov") and the image below it.
2. Visually comparing the two images, I cannot see any change in the space between the post title and the image.
3. There are no elements partially done, the space appears identical in both images.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
