Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the sidebar widgets to have a light grey background to visually separate them from the main content area.
2. Comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, the sidebar widgets appear to have a very subtle, light grey background in the 'after' image, which was not present in the 'before' image.
3. The light grey background is visible and does, to a small degree, separate the widgets visually.
