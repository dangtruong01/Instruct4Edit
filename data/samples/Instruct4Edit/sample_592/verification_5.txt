Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add space between the menu items in the sidebar. The sidebar in question is on the right side of the images, starting with "MENU".
2. Upon comparing the two images, it is difficult to ascertain that there is visually a clearly detectable increase in space between menu items in the sidebar. The differences, if any, are very subtle.
3. Due to the ambiguity and the minimal nature of the changes, it is difficult to be sure the instruction was fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
