Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a hover effect (highlight or color change) to the navigation links.
2. The images provided are static and do not show any hover interaction. It is impossible to assess whether the hover effect was added based on these images.
3. The instruction is clear, but the images do not allow for verification.

Final verdict:
