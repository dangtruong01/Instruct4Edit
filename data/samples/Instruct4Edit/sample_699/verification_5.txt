Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to center the footer links within the footer area.
2. In the provided images, there is a footer with links such as "مواصفات ورقة الإمتحان". These links are not visibly centered in the "after" image compared to their placement in the "before" image. They remain left-aligned.
3. There's no change in the visual alignment of the footer links.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
