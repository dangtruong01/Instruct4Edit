Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to give a subtle rounded edge to "the main image at the top of the article, the one showing the 'Cattura.png' graphic."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. In both the "before" and "after" images, the area described as "the top of the article" (specifically the large green banner below the navigation) does not contain any visible image, let alone one named "Cattura.png". Since the target image is not present in either screenshot, the instructed change of adding a subtle rounded edge cannot be observed or verified. There are no visual changes between the two images related to an image being rounded at the top of the article.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the critical element to which the change should be applied (the "Cattura.png" graphic) is entirely absent from both provided "before" and "after" screenshots. Therefore, it is impossible to assess whether the instruction to round its edges was implemented, as the prerequisite element is missing.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
