Here's the review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to increase the vertical spacing (empty space/padding/margin) specifically above and below the textual and link content found within the footer section at the bottom of the page. The goal is to provide more breathing room around the footer's elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Empty space above the footer content:** Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, there is a noticeably larger gap between the horizontal line (which effectively marks the top boundary of the main footer content block) and the "© 2023 Sisthema Formazione..." text. This indicates an increase in the empty space above the primary content within the footer.
    *   **Empty space below the footer content:** Yes, this change is also clearly visible. In the "after" image, the final element in the footer, the "MOODLE" link, has significantly more empty space below it before reaching the bottom edge of the page/screenshot. This indicates an increase in the empty space below the content within the footer.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. Both aspects of the instruction ("above" and "below") have been clearly implemented. The footer section is well-defined by its content at the bottom of the page, and the visual increase in whitespace around that content is unambiguous.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
