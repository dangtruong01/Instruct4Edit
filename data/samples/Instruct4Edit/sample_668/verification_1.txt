**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that "When you move your mouse over the main navigation links at the top of the page (like "Home" or "Corsi"), make them change to a different color." This describes an interactive visual change: the color of the navigation links should change *on hover*.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, all the main navigation links (e.g., "Home", "Chi Siamo", "Corsi", "News") appear to be the exact same black color in both images. There is no visual indication in the "after" image that any of these links have changed color, or that a hover state with a different color has been implemented and is being demonstrated. A static image can only show a specific moment in time. To visually confirm a hover state, the "after" image would ideally need to show at least one of the navigation links rendered in its new, "hovered" color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts. The instruction describes a dynamic, interactive behavior (on mouse hover), which is challenging to verify with two static images alone. The "after" image provides no visual evidence that the hover effect has been applied, as all elements appear identical to the "before" image in terms of the navigation link colors. Therefore, based *solely* on the visual comparison of these two static screenshots, it is impossible to confirm that the instruction was implemented.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (or rather, Not Visually Confirmable)
