**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two main visual changes to the navigation menu items:
    *   Their text should be a bit bolder to make them more distinct.
    *   They should clearly highlight when hovered over.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. The "before" image displays the full page, including the navigation menu items ("Home", "About", "Death News", "Obituary", "Victim"). However, the "after" image is almost entirely blank and does not display any of the UI elements present in the "before" image, including the navigation menu. Therefore, it is impossible to visually verify if the text of the menu items is bolder or if any hover states have been applied or changed. The "after" image only contains a textual description of what was done, not a visual representation of the changes.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements. The UI that was supposed to be modified and displayed for comparison is entirely absent in the "after" image. This makes any visual verification of the instruction impossible.

**Final verdict:**
