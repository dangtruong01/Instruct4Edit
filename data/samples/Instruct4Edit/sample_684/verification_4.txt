Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to apply styling (more internal space, and potentially a subtle border or background) to elements located specifically within a "right-hand sidebar," such as a search box, to visually separate them from the main article content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible.
    *   **Right-hand sidebar:** In both the "before" and "after" images, there is no visible right-hand sidebar. The layout appears to be a single-column structure for the main content area.
    *   **Elements within:** The instruction refers to elements *inside* this non-existent right-hand sidebar. The search box and button, mentioned as an example, are located at the very bottom of the page, below the "Leave a Comment" section, not within any sidebar.
    *   **Internal space/Border/Background:** Since the target (a right-hand sidebar) does not exist, and the search box is not within such a sidebar, the requested visual changes (more internal space, subtle border, or background for separation from the main article) have not been applied to any relevant element in the "after" image. There are no discernible visual changes to the search box or its surrounding area between the two images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the primary issue is the fundamental premise of the instruction: it refers to a "right-hand sidebar" that is entirely absent from both the "before" and "after" designs. Without this structural element, the instruction cannot be fulfilled as written. If the intent was to apply these changes to the search box wherever it is located, even then, no such changes are visible.
