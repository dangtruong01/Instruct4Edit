**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reduce the size and prominence of the website logo (represented by the large blank area in the top-left header) and, as a consequence, free up space in the header for other elements to potentially move higher or be placed more efficiently.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes.
    *   In the "before" image, the top-left area designated for the logo is a very large, tall, and wide blank rectangle.
    *   In the "after" image, this same blank rectangle has been significantly reduced in both height and width. This makes it visually much smaller and less dominant.
    *   Furthermore, due to this reduction in the logo's allocated space, the "Menu" button and its associated dropdown navigation links (Home, Biography, Death News, Death, Celebrity, Victim) have moved considerably upwards in the "after" image, occupying the space that was previously taken by the larger logo area. This clearly demonstrates that more space has been allowed for other header elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    None. The visual evidence directly and clearly demonstrates that the logo area has shrunk, it is less dominant, and this has allowed more space for other header elements to move upwards.

**Final verdict:**
