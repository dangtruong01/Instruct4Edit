### Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to increase the vertical spacing (white space) between distinct paragraphs and other content elements (like quotes, lists, or embeds) within the main article body. The goal is to improve text flow and readability by providing more "breathing room" between content blocks.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is a noticeable increase in the vertical space separating the following elements within the article body:
    *   Between the article meta-information (date/author) and the first paragraph.
    *   Between the first paragraph and the embedded quote block.
    *   Between the quote block and the second paragraph.
    *   Between the second paragraph and the third paragraph.
    *   Between the third paragraph and the "Also Read:" section.
    *   Between the "Also Read:" section and the final paragraph.
    *   Between the final paragraph and the "Categories:" section.
    *   Between the "Tags:" section and the "Leave a Comment" heading.

    This consistent application of increased vertical spacing significantly enhances the visual separation of content blocks, making the article easier to scan and read.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was general ("add more vertical space") and did not specify a precise amount or exact elements beyond examples like "paragraphs and other elements, like embedded social media posts." While there isn't an explicit social media post visible, the principle of adding space between *all* distinct content elements within the article body has been applied consistently and effectively to the visible elements. The change is clear and positive for readability.
