Here's my cautious review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requires an image within the article to be present and to automatically adjust its size to fill the available content width of the page. This means a visual expansion of an image to fit the page width, replacing any fixed-size or small/broken image display.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Both the "before" and "after" images are visually identical. In both images, there is only a small broken image placeholder icon (indicating a missing image file) at the bottom-left of the article content. This placeholder does not adjust its size to fit the page width and is certainly not an actual image displaying the intended behavior.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements and ambiguities based on the visual evidence:
    *   **No Image Present:** The core issue is the complete absence of an actual image. The instruction is about how an *image* should behave, but only a broken placeholder is shown.
    *   **No Size Adjustment Demonstrated:** Since there's no actual image, it's impossible to visually verify if it "automatically adjusts its size to fit the width of the page." The placeholder's small, fixed size does not demonstrate this responsiveness.
    *   **No Change from "Before" to "After":** Visually, nothing has changed between the two states, which strongly suggests the instruction has not been implemented or is not observable from the provided screenshots.

Final verdict:
