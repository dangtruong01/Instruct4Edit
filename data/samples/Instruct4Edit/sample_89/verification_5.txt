Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for the text color in the very bottom footer section to be changed to a lighter shade, specifically "like a soft gray." This refers to the text "Mommy Expressions" on the left and "Proudly powered by WordPress" on the right, which are located in the absolute bottom section of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The text "Mommy Expressions" and "Proudly powered by WordPress" in the footer appears to be black or a very dark gray.
    *   **After Image:** The same text in the footer is visibly lighter. It has shifted from a dark tone to a medium-light gray, consistent with "a soft gray." The change is subtle but clearly discernible when comparing the two images side-by-side.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is applied to all text within the "very bottom footer section." The color chosen is indeed a lighter shade and fits the description of "soft gray."

**Final verdict:**
