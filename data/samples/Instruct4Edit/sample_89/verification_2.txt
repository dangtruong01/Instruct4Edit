Here's my review based on your instructions:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The main article title, "The fetal sacral tail minister has a 15 cm sizes of teratoma, don't be afraid, the MDT team of the Chengdu Maternal and Children's Center Hospital MDT team removes it", is intended to be horizontally centered on the page for increased prominence.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, in the "before" image, the main article title is clearly left-aligned. In the "after" image, the same title is visibly centered horizontally within the content area. The change is distinct and easy to observe.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, the instruction was very specific to the "main article title" and its centering. This particular element has been clearly moved from a left-aligned position to a centered position, precisely as instructed. Other elements on the page (like the top header, the body text, or footer) were not part of the instruction and remain unchanged.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
