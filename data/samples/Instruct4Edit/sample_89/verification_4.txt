Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a "subtle, light background color" to the section displaying the post date and author information ("Posted 2023年11月3日 in GrowingUpGems By admin"). The purpose is to help this section stand out from the surrounding content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon close inspection, the section displaying the post date and author information in the "after" image retains the exact same white background as the "before" image. There is no discernible light or subtle background color added to this area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no doubt. The instruction to add a background color was not visually implemented. The specified section's background remains unchanged between the two images.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
