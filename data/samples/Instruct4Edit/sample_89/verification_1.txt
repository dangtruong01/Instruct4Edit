Here is my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction targets the "Mommy Expressions" title located at the very top of the page. The intended visual changes are to increase its font size (make it larger) and increase its font-weight (make it bolder).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Larger:** Comparing the "Mommy Expressions" title in the first (original) image to the second (modified) image, the text in the modified image is distinctly larger in size.
    *   **Bolder:** The font-weight of the "Mommy Expressions" title in the modified image is also visibly heavier and darker, indicating it has been made bolder compared to the original.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. Both aspects of the instruction ("larger" and "bolder") have been clearly and effectively implemented in the modified image. The change is pronounced and easily discernible.

**Final verdict:**
