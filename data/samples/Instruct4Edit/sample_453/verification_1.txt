Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation bar slightly transparent. This means that the background of the navigation bar should allow the content behind it to be partially visible.
2. By comparing the two images, there is no visible transparency applied to the navigation bar. The background color remains solid and opaque.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
