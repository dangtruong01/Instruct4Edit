Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the image beside the movie details. However, there's no image to apply the shadow to in the original or modified images.
2. Since there is no image present beside the movie details in either image, no shadow can be added.
3. The instruction refers to an image that is not present in the provided context, making the change impossible to implement.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
