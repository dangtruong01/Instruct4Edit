Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to move the navigation links, presumably referring to the "HOMEVEHICLESBMW" on the left, closer to the center of the page.
2. Comparing the two images, the position of "HOMEVEHICLESBMW" remains the same. There is no visible change in the location of the navigation links.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible in the images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
