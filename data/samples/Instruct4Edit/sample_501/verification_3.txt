Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires changing the dashed border around the coupons to a solid line.
2. Comparing the two images, the borders around the coupons remain dashed in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
