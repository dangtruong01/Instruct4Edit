Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the social media icons in the footer appear in color instead of plain text.
2. Comparing the two images, the social media icons in the footer (Facebook, Google, Twitter, Yelp, Instagram) are plain text in both images. There is no visual change in the icons.
3. There is no visible change, so the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
