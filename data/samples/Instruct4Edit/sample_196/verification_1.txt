Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction "Make the header stick to the top of the page as the user scrolls" means that the header, which likely includes the breadcrumb "/ debian /" and the "7 directories 7 files" information, should remain visible even when the user scrolls down the page. The two images provided are static and do not show the effect of scrolling. Therefore, it is impossible to determine if the instruction was implemented correctly based on the images.
2. There is no visual difference between the two images. We cannot see if the header sticks to the top upon scrolling.
3. The instruction implies a dynamic behavior (scrolling), which is not represented in a static image.

Final verdict:
