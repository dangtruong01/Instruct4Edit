Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle box shadow to the header. The header is defined by the line with "Name", "Size", and "Modified".
2. Comparing the images, it is difficult to discern any change to the header in the second image. There appears to be no box shadow added.
3. The primary ambiguity is the definition of "subtle." However, there should be at least *some* visual indication of a shadow if the instruction was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
