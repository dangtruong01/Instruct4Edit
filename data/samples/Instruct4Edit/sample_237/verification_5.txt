**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing (or "breathing room") between each individual "Related Post" item listed under the "Related Posts" section at the bottom of the article.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is visible. In the "before" image, the lines of text under "Related Posts" (e.g., "Some sort of ten most wealthy You actually For Scotland Revealed", "That why not check here Khaotics Interaction", and "Montana Seeing Laws and regulation Ar Is bbw-dating usually Dating Unsuitable Depending on the E-book!") are relatively close together. In the "after" image, a discernible amount of extra vertical space has been added between each of these lines, making them feel less cramped and providing more "breathing room" as instructed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is clearly applied to the specified elements ("Related Posts") and the nature of the change (adding vertical space) is evident. No other unrelated elements seem to have been affected by this specific instruction.

**Final verdict:**
