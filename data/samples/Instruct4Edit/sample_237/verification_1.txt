Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the website name "Автосалон MyCityCar" at the top left more prominent. This prominence should be achieved by:
    *   Increasing its font size.
    *   Making it bolder.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Size:** Yes, in the "after" image, "Автосалон MyCityCar" is visibly larger than in the "before" image.
    *   **Boldness:** Yes, in the "after" image, the text "Автосалон MyCityCar" appears to have a heavier font weight (bolder) compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Prominence:** As a result of both changes, the text is indeed more prominent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the changes are clear and directly address both parts of the instruction (size and boldness).

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
