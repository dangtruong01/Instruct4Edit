Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between individual lines of text within the main paragraphs of the article. This is commonly referred to as increasing "line-height" or "leading" in typography. The goal is to make the text appear less dense and improve readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly and consistently visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the spacing between lines of text within all the main article content paragraphs (e.g., under "No Deposit Supplementary Casino Australian continent Cell", "Dependable Casinos on the net In australia", "Gang of Merely Gambling enterprises Accredited Around australia 2021", etc.) has been increased. The text now appears to have more "air" between lines, making it less cramped and easier to follow. The bullet points within the main content also exhibit this increased line spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. The change is uniformly applied to all the large blocks of text that constitute the primary article content. Elements like headings, navigation links, and the "Related Posts" section (which could be considered secondary content or a sidebar) do not appear to have had their line spacing altered, but the instruction specifically targeted "main article content," which has been fully addressed.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
