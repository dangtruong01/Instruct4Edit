Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to add a clear visual separation (specifically suggesting a border or a subtle background) around *each* distinct content block located in the sidebar. This separation was intended to make these blocks, such as "Машина дня" and "Свежие записи", stand out more clearly and be easily identifiable as separate UI components.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible. In the "before" image, the various content blocks on the right side (acting as a sidebar), such as "Краткое меню", "Поделиться ссылкой", "Машина дня", "Найти:", and "Свежие записи", are presented as plain text or elements without any distinct visual grouping. In contrast, the "after" image shows that each of these distinct blocks has been enclosed within a light grey background and a very subtle border. This consistent application of visual styling effectively separates each block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. The instruction requested separation for "each distinct block", and the "after" image demonstrates that all relevant distinct blocks in the sidebar area have received the specified visual treatment (both a subtle background and a border). The chosen style is consistent, clear, and achieves the goal of making the blocks stand out without being visually overwhelming.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
