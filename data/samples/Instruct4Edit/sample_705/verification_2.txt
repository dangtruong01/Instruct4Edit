Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the active page number in the pagination more prominent by changing its color to a brighter one.
2. In the "before" image, page "1" is the active one and its color is dark orange. In the "after" image, the active page number "1" has the same dark orange color. There is no apparent change in the color.
3. The active page number color was not changed, thus, the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
