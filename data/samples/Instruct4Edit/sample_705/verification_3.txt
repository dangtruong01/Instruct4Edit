Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect to the video thumbnails. This would make the thumbnails appear to "lift" slightly from the background, improving visual hierarchy and making them more noticeable.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, I can't see any difference in the video thumbnails. There is no discernable shadow effect applied.
3. I see no evidence of any shadow being implemented around the thumbnails.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
