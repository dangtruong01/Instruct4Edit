Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the search input field have rounded corners.
2. Comparing the two images, the search input field in the "after" image does not appear to have rounded corners. It still has sharp, square corners like the "before" image.
3. There are no visible rounded corners in the second image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
