Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the logo smaller in the header to reduce vertical space. However, there is no visible logo. Therefore, it is impossible to verify if the instruction has been applied.
2. Since there is no visible logo in the before and after images, there is no way to determine if the instruction was applied.
3. The instruction refers to a logo but there's no logo visible in the images, so it's impossible to verify.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
