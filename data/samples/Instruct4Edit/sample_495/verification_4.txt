Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires increasing the spacing between list items in the "Popular Tests" section of the footer.
2. By comparing the two images, it is difficult to observe any noticeable change in the spacing between the list items under "Popular Tests" in the footer. The items appear to be spaced similarly in both images.
3. There is no clear visual evidence that the instruction has been implemented.

Final verdict:
