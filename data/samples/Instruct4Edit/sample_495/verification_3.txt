Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction aims to improve the usability of the cart icon and text on mobile devices by combining them into a single, larger, and more easily tappable area. This likely involves visually grouping the icon and text together and ensuring that clicking either element triggers the same action (navigating to the cart).
2. Comparing the two images, there are no visible changes to the cart icon or text. They appear to be in the same position and of the same size. It is not possible to assess whether the clickable area has been enlarged or combined without further interaction. However, based on visual inspection alone, no change is apparent.
3. The absence of any visible change in the "after" image raises doubts about whether the instruction was implemented.
