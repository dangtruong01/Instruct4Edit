Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the main content area to give it more depth. The main content area appears to be the white box containing the sign-up form.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot detect any visible shadow around the white box.
3. There are no visible changes.

Final verdict:
