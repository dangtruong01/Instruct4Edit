Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for padding around the content inside each sidebar box (Links, Categories, Archives, Popular Posts, Latest Posts, Subscribe to Feeds, Links, Meta) and a subtle border to visually separate them.
2. Comparing the images, it's hard to see any noticeable change. The sidebar boxes still appear to run together without any clear visual separation. There is no padding around the content within the boxes, and no borders can be seen between them.
3. There is no visual evidence of the requested padding or borders in the modified image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
