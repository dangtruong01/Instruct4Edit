Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a more readable font to be used for the main body text. This implies a change in the font-family, font-size, or both.
2. Comparing the two images, there is a subtle change in the body text font. The font appears slightly different and potentially more legible in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. However, the change isn't drastic.
3. Although the change is subtle, it seems like an attempt was made to apply a more readable font. It's possible that the original font was already fairly legible and therefore the change is minor.

Final verdict:
