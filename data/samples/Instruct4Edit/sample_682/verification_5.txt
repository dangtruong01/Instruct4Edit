**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the borders and dividing lines throughout the page less visually dominant. This could mean making them thinner, lighter in color, or perhaps rounding their corners slightly, to achieve a more modern, less "boxed-in" or "rigid" appearance. The goal is a "cleaner, less rigid feel."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon meticulous comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the hard lines and prominent borders around content boxes and sections appear identical in both images.
    *   The main outer border of the "WiseBiology Forum Index" section remains the same.
    *   The borders around the "Search Query" and "Search Options" blue header bars show no change.
    *   The internal grid lines and borders separating the different input fields and labels within the search form also remain unchanged in thickness, color, and prominence.
    *   The borders of the input fields themselves (text boxes, dropdowns) are also precisely the same.
    There is no discernible softening, reduction in prominence, or change in the rigidity of the design elements as instructed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction appears to be entirely unapplied. Both images are visually identical in terms of the lines and borders.

**Final verdict:**
