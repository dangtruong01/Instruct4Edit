Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the logo and the navigation links in the header. I cannot see a logo in either of the images. The navigation links are "HOME", "ABOUT US", and "PODCAST" on the top right.
2. Since there's no logo, the instruction cannot be fulfilled.
3. The main ambiguity is the missing logo.

Final verdict:
