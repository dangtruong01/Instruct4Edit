Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add padding to the left and right sides of the main article content. This should result in a visible space between the text and the edges of the container, making the content less crammed against the sides.
2. Upon comparing the two images, it's difficult to definitively say whether the padding has been added, especially considering the original image already has some margin. The difference is very subtle.
3. Due to the minimal change (if any), there's some doubt about the instruction's proper implementation. It's possible that a very small amount of padding was added, making the change barely noticeable.

Final verdict:
