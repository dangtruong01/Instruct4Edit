Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires adding a subtle shadow effect to the featured image.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot detect any difference in shadowing around the featured image. It appears identical in both images.
3. There's no visible change to confirm the instruction was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
