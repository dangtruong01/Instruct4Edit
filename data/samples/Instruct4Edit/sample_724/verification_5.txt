Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction states that the article titles in the "Recommended" sidebar should wrap to multiple lines if they are too long. This means that if a title exceeds the width of its container, it should break and continue on a new line.
2. By comparing the two images, we can see that the article titles in the "Recommended" sidebar in the "after" image do indeed wrap to multiple lines when they are too long. This is most visible in the 4th title: "Preguntas incómodas acerca del trabajo y el matrimonio".
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements in the implementation.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
