Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header area. The header area appears to be the top section of the website with the title "Recrutamos.com".
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible shadow added to the header area in the "after" image. The header in both images looks identical.
3. There's no evidence of any shadow effect being implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
