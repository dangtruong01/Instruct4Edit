**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction states that when a user hovers their mouse over a primary navigation link, its background color should subtly change. This implies a dynamic visual alteration of the link's background when interacted with.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. In both the "before" and "after" images, the primary navigation links (e.g., "首页概况", "铆螺母", "抽芯铆钉") all consistently maintain a white background. There is no visible change in the background color of any of these links in the "after" image that would indicate a hover state has been applied or demonstrated.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, significant doubts. The instruction describes a dynamic interaction (hover state), which is challenging to verify from static images unless one of the elements is explicitly shown in its new state (e.g., one link with a changed background color). Since the "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image in terms of the primary navigation links' backgrounds, it fails to demonstrate that the hover effect has been implemented. As a reviewer focused solely on visual changes, I cannot confirm the instruction was applied.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
