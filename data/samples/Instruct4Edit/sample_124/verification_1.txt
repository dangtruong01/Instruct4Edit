Here's my cautious review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Increase the font size of the article's main title.
    *   Increase the boldness (font weight) of the article's main title.
    *   Decrease the font size of the publication date and source text beneath the title.
    *   Change the color of the publication date and source text beneath the title to a lighter shade.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Article's main title size:** Comparing "拉铆钉和铆钉的区别介绍" in both images, the font size appears to be identical. No increase in size is visible.
    *   **Article's main title boldness:** Comparing the boldness of the title, the font weight appears to be identical. No increase in boldness is visible.
    *   **Publication date and source text smaller:** Comparing "时间: 2023-01-06 14:14:21 (阅读次数)" in both images, the font size appears to be identical. No decrease in size is visible.
    *   **Publication date and source text lighter shade:** Comparing the color of this text, it appears to be the exact same shade of grey in both images. No change to a lighter shade is visible.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are significant doubts because, upon careful visual inspection, none of the instructed changes (increase size/boldness of title, decrease size/lighten shade of date/source) appear to have been applied at all. The relevant elements look identical in both the "before" and "after" images.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
