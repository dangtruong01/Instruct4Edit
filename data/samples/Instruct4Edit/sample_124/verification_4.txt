Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing specifically between the very end of the main article content (which includes the "下一篇" link) and the beginning of the "Related News" section (marked by the "相关新闻" heading).
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, comparing the two images, there is a clear and noticeable increase in the vertical white space between the line "下一篇：已经是最后一篇了" and the "相关新闻" heading in the "after" image, compared to the "before" image where they are much closer.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is precise, clearly visible, and directly addresses the instruction without any ambiguity.

Final verdict:
- ✅ Fully Applied
