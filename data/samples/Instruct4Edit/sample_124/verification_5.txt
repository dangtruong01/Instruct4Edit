Here's the detailed review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states to "Round out all corners of the 'About Us' section title box in the left sidebar, not just the top right." This means that the top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the blue title box should be made rounded, matching the already rounded top-right corner.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In the "before" image, the blue "About Us" title box prominently features a rounded top-right corner, while the top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners appear sharp/square.
    In the "after" image, a clear visual difference is observed: the top-left, bottom-left, and bottom-right corners of the "About Us" title box have all been rounded. All four corners now exhibit the same degree of rounding.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is very clear and unambiguously applied. All specified corners that were previously sharp are now rounded.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
