**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform all navigation links in the left-hand column into a "modern, uniform button-like appearance." This includes ensuring consistent spacing between them and implementing a "clear hover state." The instruction specifically mentions both "image-based ones and text-only ones," suggesting the design should accommodate both types if they exist in the left navigation.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **"modern, uniform button-like appearance"**: In the "before" image, the left navigation consisted of a few inconsistently sized, rigid blue rectangles. In the "after" image, a significant number of new navigation items have been added, and *all* visible items in the left column now share a consistent, darker blue rectangular button-like appearance with white text. This clearly achieves uniformity and a distinct button feel.
    *   **"consistent spacing between them"**: The vertical spacing between all the navigation buttons in the "after" image is visually uniform, a clear improvement over the less organized "before" state (which had fewer items, making spacing less of an issue, but the new design clearly adheres to consistency).
    *   **"clear hover state"**: While a static image cannot *show* a dynamic hover action, the "Home" button in the "after" image is visibly a lighter shade of blue than the rest of the navigation buttons. This lighter shade strongly suggests it is either an active state (the current page) or a visual representation of the intended hover state, demonstrating that a "clear" visual change for interaction exists.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **"image-based ones"**: The instruction specifies "both the image-based ones and the text-only ones." However, neither the "before" nor the "after" image displays any "image-based" navigation links within the left-hand column. Since no such elements are visually present in the provided screenshots for the left navigation, the instruction could only be applied to the text-based links that are visible. Therefore, for the scope of the provided images, the instruction is fully applied to all *relevant* elements. If image-based links exist elsewhere in the system (not shown in the left column), their treatment is unknown, but this review is limited to the provided visuals.
    *   **"clear hover state"**: As noted, the "Home" button's distinct color serves as a clear indication of a state change. For a static image, this is the standard way to convey the design of a dynamic state. There's no ambiguity in *what* the hover state would look like, only that it's a single example.

**Final verdict:**
