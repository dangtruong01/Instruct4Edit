Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the "Search" button's color in the sidebar to be more visually prominent. This means the button should stand out more compared to its original state.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the "Search" button in the sidebar has indeed changed to a blue color. This makes it more visually prominent than the original grey button.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The button is clearly visible and its color has changed as requested.

Final verdict:
