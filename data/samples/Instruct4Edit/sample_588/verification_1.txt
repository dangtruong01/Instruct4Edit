Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the header "DMCA Digital Millennium Copyright Act Policy". This shadow is meant to visually separate the header from the rest of the content.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible difference around the header. It does not appear that a shadow effect has been added.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the requested visual change is not present in the after image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
