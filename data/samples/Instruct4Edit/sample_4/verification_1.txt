Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to increase the spacing between the logo and the search form. This means the gap between the logo (in this case, the "www.lonestar.org" text and the image above it) and the search bar should be wider in the "after" image.

2.  **Visibility of Change:**  I do not see a clear increase in the spacing. The distance between the logo/website name and the search form appears to be the same in both images.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The change is not evident.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
