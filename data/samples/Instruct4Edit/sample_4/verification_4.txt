Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to add more padding around the text within the "Recently queried sites" section. This implies that the spacing between the text and the edges of the section should increase.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    The "Recently queried sites" section is present in both images. However, it is not clear if the requested change has been applied. Both sections look the same.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, because the change is not visually apparent and therefore ambiguous.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
