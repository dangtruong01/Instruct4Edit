Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is the addition of a subtle background color to the "World Ranking" section to make it stand out.
2. The "World Ranking" section appears to be the area containing the globe icon and the numerical rank. There is no immediately visible background color change in the "after" image.
3. The instruction indicates a "subtle" background color. Without a clear visual change, it's impossible to confirm the implementation, even if the color is subtle.

Final verdict:
