Here's a breakdown of the design change implementation:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction was to increase the font size of the headings. Headings are "API Keys," "Create API Key," "Revoke API Key," "Edit API Key," "Using API Keys," and "Security Considerations."

2.  **Observed Change:** Comparing the "after" image to the "before" image, the headings appear to have a larger font size.

3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities/Missing elements:** There are no apparent elements that are missing, the font sizes have been increased across all the headings.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
