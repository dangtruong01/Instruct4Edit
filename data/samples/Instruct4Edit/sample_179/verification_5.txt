Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Increase the whitespace (empty space) below the images/elements within the main content area.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** I see no difference. Both images look identical to each other.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes. The instruction was to add space and I see no added space between elements.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
