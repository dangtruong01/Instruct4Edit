Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction specifies two visual changes: 1) Make the navigation bar's background a solid color, and 2) increase the spacing between menu items.

2.  **Visibility of Changes:**
    *   **Solid Background:** The "after" image's navigation bar does not have a clear solid color background compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Spacing:** The space between the menu items looks the same in both images.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** Both requested visual changes are not apparent in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
