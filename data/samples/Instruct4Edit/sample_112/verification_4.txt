Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main header to make it stand out more.
2. Comparing the two images, I can't see any shadow added to the main header.
3. There's no shadow visible in the "after" image, therefore the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
