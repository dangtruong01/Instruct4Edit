Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The heading "Hailsham Grange" should be much larger in the "after" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The size of "Hailsham Grange" in the "after" image appears identical to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the design change was not applied.

**Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied**
