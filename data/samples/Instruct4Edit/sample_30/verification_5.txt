Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is a subtle shadow added to the navigation bar.
2. It is very difficult to say with certainty, as the navigation bar itself is white and the shadow would need to be very subtle to have an effect. However, I'm not seeing a visible shadow.
3. The instruction specifies a "subtle shadow." It's possible a shadow was added so subtle that it's nearly undetectable, or perhaps the change was not implemented.

Final verdict:
