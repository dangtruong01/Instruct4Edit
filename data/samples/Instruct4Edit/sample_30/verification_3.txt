❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a change in the color of the social media icons to a brighter, eye-catching color.
2. There are no social media icons in either the before or after images.
3. As there are no social media icons, it is impossible to determine if the color was changed.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
