Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons to the brand's primary color when they're clicked (presumably when they're in the "selected" or "active" state).
2. In the after image, the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons appear to have a blue fill when selected, which is likely the brand's primary color. This is a clear change from the before image, where they appear to be grayscale.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
