Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation links (Submit Ticket, Login, Listings, Homepage) in the header more visually distinct. This can be achieved by adding a background color to each link or adding a dividing line between them.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no visual difference in the header's navigation links. They appear identical in both images.
3. There's no background color or dividing line added to visually distinguish the navigation links in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
