Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the sidebar, which contains related articles, to be permanently visible instead of sliding in. In essence, it should always be present on the page.
2. The images provided do not show the actual sliding behavior of the sidebar in the "before" state. The "after" image appears identical to the "before" image. It's impossible to determine if the sidebar is permanently visible now. We can't see it sliding in or out in either image. It appears as if the sidebar might already be visible in the before image, so there's no change.
3. The images are ambiguous. We cannot determine whether the instruction was implemented based on these two snapshots alone.

Final verdict:
