Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color of the navigation menu to a lighter and more modern shade. By navigation menu, I assume this refers to the top portion of the website with the image and the text "Sejarah Seni & Perupa Yadnya di Bali".
2. Comparing the two images, there is NO visual change to the background color of the navigation menu. It appears to be the same in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but it clearly hasn't been implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
