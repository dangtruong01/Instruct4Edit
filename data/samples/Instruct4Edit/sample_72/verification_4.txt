Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for more spacing between the sidebar widgets to reduce clutter. This means increasing the vertical space between the "ARTIKEL" and "TENTANG HALAMAN INI" sections, and the items within the "ARTIKEL" section.
2. Visually, the spacing between the sidebar widgets in the "after" image appears slightly greater than in the "before" image. However, the change is subtle.
3. Although there is a slight visual difference, it might not be enough to significantly reduce the feeling of clutter. A more substantial increase in spacing might have been more effective.
