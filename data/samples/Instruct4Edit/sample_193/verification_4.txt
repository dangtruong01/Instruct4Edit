Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requested that the heading "24,446 Followers" have more visual weight, either by making it bolder or slightly larger.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font weight and size of the heading appear to be identical. There is no noticeable change in boldness or size.
3. Therefore, the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
