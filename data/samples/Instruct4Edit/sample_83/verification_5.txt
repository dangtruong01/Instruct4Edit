Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks to "Increase the default visibility of the navigation arrows positioned on the left and right sides of the page." This implies making the arrows more prominent, darker, larger, or giving them more contrast against the background so they are easier for a user to see and interact with by default.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No.
In both the "before" and "after" images, there are extremely faint grey arrows positioned on the far left and far right sides of the page, roughly in the vertical middle. These arrows are almost indistinguishable from the white background due to their very light color and low contrast. Upon close comparison, there is absolutely no discernible change in their color, size, opacity, or any other visual attribute in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. Their visibility remains exactly the same – effectively, very low or non-existent.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts regarding the *lack* of change. The instruction clearly states "increase the default visibility," but the visibility has not increased at all. The arrows are just as difficult to see in the "after" image as they were in the "before" image. The intended visual change (making them more visible) is entirely missing.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
