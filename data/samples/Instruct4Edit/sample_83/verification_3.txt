Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to modify a "large image displayed on the right" by softening its "distinctive angled edge." The goal is to transform this edge into either a traditional rectangular shape (with 90-degree corners) or a more subtle curve (like rounded corners).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Upon careful comparison of both images, it is evident that they are identical. More importantly, there is no "large image displayed on the right" with a "distinctive angled edge" present in either the "before" or the "after" image. The layout primarily consists of text content on the right side and a wide blank margin on the left.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant ambiguity. The instruction refers to a specific design element ("the large image displayed on the right with a distinctive angled edge") that does not exist in the provided "before" image. Since the target element of the instruction is absent, the instruction cannot be applied. Furthermore, as the "after" image is identical to the "before" image, no attempt seems to have been made to implement any changes.

Final verdict:
