Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests an increase in vertical spacing *around* the main event title ("DÉBAT - RICHESSES DE L'ÉPHÉMÈRE sous les arbres"). This implies adding more whitespace both *above* and *below* the title, creating more "breathing room" from the top of the page and from the event details (starting with "Ma 1 juin 2021...") below it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Spacing above the title:** Yes, there is a clear increase in the vertical space between the very top edge of the document (or the top margin) and the "DÉBAT" line of the title. The entire content block appears to have shifted downwards.
    *   **Spacing below the title:** No, the vertical space between the last line of the title ("sous les arbres") and the first line of the event details ("Ma 1 juin 2021...") appears to be *identical* in both the "before" and "after" images. The entire content block simply moved down, preserving the internal spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are missing elements. The instruction specified "around the main event title" and "from the surrounding content". While the spacing above the title increased, the spacing *between the title and the content immediately following it* (the event details) did not change at all. This means the title still has the same amount of "breathing room" from the content below it, which contradicts the spirit of the instruction for "more breathing room from the surrounding content" on both sides.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied (or more accurately, only partially applied in a way that doesn't fully meet the intent)
