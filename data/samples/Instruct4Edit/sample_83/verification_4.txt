Here's the detailed UI/UX review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to reduce the visual prominence of three specific horizontal lines:
    *   The line separating the event's date from the ticket information.
    *   The line separating the ticket information from the following content block ("En respect des règles sanitaires...").
    *   The line separating the main body text from the credits section ("Photo @ Katharina Lutscher").
The reduction in prominence (ideally removal) should be compensated by increasing the vertical spacing between these sections, relying on whitespace to create clear visual distinctions instead of solid lines.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly and prominently visible in the "after" image.
*   **Event's date / Ticket information:** The dark horizontal line that was present directly below "Ma 1 juin 2021, 18:45, Jardin botanique de Neuchâtel" in the "before" image is completely absent in the "after" image. The vertical space between this text and "Ch. du Pertuis-du-Sault 58, www.jbneuchatel.ch" has been significantly increased.
*   **Ticket information / "En respect..." paragraph:** The dark horizontal line that was present below "+41 79 643 95 32" in the "before" image is completely absent in the "after" image. The vertical space between this text and "En respect des règles sanitaires..." has been significantly increased.
*   **Main content / Credits:** The dark horizontal line that was present below the speaker biographies and above "Photo @ Katharina Lutscher" in the "before" image is completely absent in the "after" image. The vertical space between "Frankfurter Weber." and "Photo @ Katharina Lutscher" has been significantly increased.
In all three specified instances, the lines have been entirely removed, and the vertical spacing has been visibly increased to compensate, fulfilling the instruction's intent to rely more on spacing.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements regarding the specified lines. The instruction clearly identified "the event's date, ticket information, and credits." The horizontal lines separating the individual speaker biographies were not part of this specific instruction, and their continued presence (consistent with the "before" image) does not negate the successful application of the given instruction. The intended reduction in visual prominence (achieved by complete removal) and the reliance on spacing are fully implemented for the targeted sections.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
