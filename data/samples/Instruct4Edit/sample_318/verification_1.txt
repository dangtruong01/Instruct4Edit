Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the borders of the main table lighter and less harsh. This means the lines should appear visually thinner or of a lighter color compared to the "before" image.
2. Visually comparing the images, the table borders appear identical in both images. There is no perceptible change in the line weight or color of the table borders.
3. There is no doubt that the borders look the same in both images.

Final verdict:
