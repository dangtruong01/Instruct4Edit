Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the font size and darken the color of the text in the footer to improve readability.
2. Comparing the two images, there doesn't seem to be a noticeable change in the font size or the color of the text in the footer. It's very difficult to discern any difference.
3. The change is not clearly visible, and it's possible that the instruction wasn't applied or wasn't applied correctly.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
