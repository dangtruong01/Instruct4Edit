Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to left-align the copyright information in the footer. This means that the text should be aligned to the left edge of its container.
2. Looking at the "before" image, the copyright information appears to be left-aligned. Looking at the "after" image, the copyright information also appears to be left-aligned.
3. There's no visible change between the two images. The information was already aligned to the left side.

Final verdict:
