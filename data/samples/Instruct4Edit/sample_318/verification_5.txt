Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add padding around the main content area. This means increasing the space between the content and the edges of its container.
2. Comparing the images, I cannot definitively see any added padding around the main content area. The content appears to be positioned in the same way.
3. There are no obvious visual changes to suggest that padding has been added.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
