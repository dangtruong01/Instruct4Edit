Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Increase the spacing between the list items within the content section. The content section appears to be the long block of text.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** I do not see any change in spacing between the list items within the content section.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
