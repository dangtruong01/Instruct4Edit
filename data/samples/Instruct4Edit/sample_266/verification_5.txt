Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requests the text in the navigation bar to be a bolder weight. This should make the text appear thicker and darker.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The navigation bar text appears in the "Welcome Guest ( Log In | Register )" string, and it doesn't appear any bolder in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not visible.

**Final verdict:** ❌ Not Applied
