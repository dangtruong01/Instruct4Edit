Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to make the very bottom part of the page footer visibly lighter in its background color. Additionally, it aimed to ensure that any text present in this area would be clearly legible against the newly lightened background.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Background Color:** Upon careful comparison, the background color of the very bottom strip of the page footer appears identical in both the "before" and "after" images. It remains a very light grey, consistent with the overall page background. No lightening is discernible.
    *   **Text Visibility:** In both the "before" and "after" images, there is no text present in the very bottom part of the page footer. The last visible content ends with "A WordPress Commenter on hello world!" which is part of the "Recent Comments" section above this lowest strip. Since there is no text in the specified area, the instruction to "ensure the text is clearly visible against it" cannot be verified or assessed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant issues:
    *   The primary visual change (lightening the background) is not evident; the color remains unchanged.
    *   The secondary verification (text visibility) is impossible to perform because there is no text present in the specified footer area in either image. This suggests either text was supposed to be added and wasn't, or the instruction was based on an incorrect assumption that text existed there. As a visual reviewer, I can only assess what is present.
