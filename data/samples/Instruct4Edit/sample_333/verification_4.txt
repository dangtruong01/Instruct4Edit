Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between individual paragraphs and between individual list items within any lists present in the main article content. This change should be applied consistently throughout the entire article body.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **Paragraphs:** In the "after" image, there is a distinct increase in the vertical space between all the text blocks that constitute paragraphs in the main article content. For example, compare the spacing between the introductory paragraphs under "Mobile Roulette Tables In United Kingdom" or the space between the final sentence of one paragraph and the beginning of the next throughout the article. The separation is much more pronounced, improving readability.
    *   **List Items:** The vertical spacing between items in all bulleted lists (e.g., the lists under "Online poker games for real money Uk" or "Online casino UK with no deposit bonus") has also been visibly increased in the "after" image. Individual list items are no longer as tightly packed, making each item stand out more clearly.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was "Add more vertical space between paragraphs and list items *throughout the main article content*." The visual evidence shows that this has been consistently applied to all paragraphs and list items within the main article section, from the first main heading ("Mobile Roulette Tables In United Kingdom") down to the content just before "Recent Posts". The change is clear and uniform.

Final verdict:
