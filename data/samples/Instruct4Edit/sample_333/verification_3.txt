Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two specific changes to the "search button in the sidebar":
    *   A more noticeable background color.
    *   Slightly rounded edges.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Background Color:** In the "before" image, the search button has a white background, making it blend in with the surrounding page. In the "after" image, the search button now has a light blue background. This color is distinctly different from the page background and significantly more noticeable.
    *   **Rounded Edges:** In the "before" image, the search button has sharp, 90-degree corners. In the "after" image, the corners of the search button are visibly softened and rounded. The degree of rounding appears to be "slight" as requested, rather than heavily curved.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both aspects of the instruction (more noticeable background color and slightly rounded edges) are clearly and fully implemented in the "after" image for the identified search button.

Final verdict:
