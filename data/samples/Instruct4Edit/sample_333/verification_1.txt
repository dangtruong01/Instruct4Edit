Here's my review based on your instructions:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for two distinct visual changes:
    a. To decrease the size of the logo located in the top navigation bar.
    b. To increase the spacing between the individual menu items in the top navigation bar.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **a. Logo Size Reduction:** The element "First United Kingdom Mobile Roulette" in the top-left corner is presumed to be the logo. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the size of this text (font size, height, and width occupied by the text) appears to be identical in both versions. There is no visible reduction in its size.
*   **b. Menu Item Spacing Increase:** In the top-right navigation ("Home", "Contact Us", "Our Work"), there is a clear and noticeable increase in the horizontal spacing between these three menu items in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there is a clear missing element in the implementation. While the spacing between menu items has been successfully increased, the primary instruction to "reduce the size of the logo" (assuming "First United Kingdom Mobile Roulette" is the intended logo) has not been implemented at all. The logo's size remains unchanged. Since the instruction uses "and," both conditions must be met for it to be fully applied.

**Final verdict:**
