Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The main heading ("First United Kingdom Mobile Roulette") should become larger and bolder.
    *   All sub-headings within the article text (e.g., "Mobile Roulette Tables In United Kingdom", "Free United Kingdom Mobile Roulette No Download", etc.) should be given a distinct color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Main Heading:** In the "after" image, the main heading "First United Kingdom Mobile Roulette" is noticeably larger and has a heavier (bolder) font weight compared to the "before" image. This change is clear.
    *   **Sub-headings:** In the "after" image, all identified sub-headings ("Mobile Roulette Tables In United Kingdom", "Free United Kingdom Mobile Roulette No Download", "How live casino online sites work in United Kingdom", "Online poker games for real money UK") are now blue, which is a distinct color compared to the black text of the main content and their original black color in the "before" image. This change is clear.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   No, both parts of the instruction appear to be fully and clearly implemented without any ambiguity.

Final verdict:
