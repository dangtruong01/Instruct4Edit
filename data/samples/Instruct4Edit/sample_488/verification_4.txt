Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the header at the top of the page to make it more distinct from the content below.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to discern any shadow added to the header in the second image. The header color appears consistent between both images.
3. There's a potential ambiguity as the definition of "header" isn't entirely clear. Is it the green bar with "Cases i carrers" or the very top bar with the language selection? Regardless, I can't see any difference in either.

Final verdict:
