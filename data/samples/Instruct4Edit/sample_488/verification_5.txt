Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the space between the main title "Cases i carrers" and the top of the header area. This means decreasing the margin or padding above the title.
2. By comparing the two images, the title "Cases i carrers" is not present in the second image, therefore, it's impossible to compare the spacing with the top of the header area.
3. The title is missing in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
