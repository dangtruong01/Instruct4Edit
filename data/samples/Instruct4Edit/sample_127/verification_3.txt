Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific visual changes for all "code snippet areas":
    *   Apply a distinct, light background color.
    *   Apply some internal padding.
    The overall goal is to visually separate these areas from regular text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Identification of Code Snippet Areas:** In both the "before" and "after" images, there are two distinct blocks of code:
        *   One under "Usage": `<?php add_filter( 'wpdm_dashboard_menu_actions', 'my_custom_dashboard_actions',10,1); ?>`
        *   One under "Examples": The larger multi-line PHP block starting with `<?php wpdm_add_dashboard_menu_actions(...) ... ?>`
    *   **Distinct, Light Background Color:**
        *   In the "before" image, both code blocks have a white background, identical to the surrounding page background.
        *   In the "after" image, both code blocks clearly feature a light gray background color, which is distinct from the white background of the rest of the page. This change is clearly visible.
    *   **Internal Padding:**
        *   In the "before" image, the code text appears to be directly against the invisible edges of its container.
        *   In the "after" image, there is noticeable space (padding) between the code text and the light gray background area's edges. This creates a visual buffer around the code, making it look more contained and readable. This change is also clearly visible.
    *   **Visual Separation:** Due to the combination of the new background color and the added padding, the code snippets in the "after" image are now clearly and effectively visually separated from the regular text around them.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction specifies "all the code snippet areas." The two main blocks of code identified (under "Usage" and "Examples") are indeed the primary code snippets. Other code-related elements like the list of filter hooks under "Filter Reference" are not full "code snippets" but rather individual terms. Applying a background and padding to each item in that list would not be typical for "code snippet areas" and would likely make the design cluttered. The current implementation correctly targets the multi-line code blocks that function as distinct code examples.
    *   The background color is indeed "light" and "distinct."
    *   The padding is present and appears to be "some" (i.e., not excessive, but noticeable).
    *   No doubts or ambiguities; the instruction has been accurately interpreted and applied to the relevant visual elements.
