Here's the review of the visual changes:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intended to make the search input field at the top of the page more prominent by:
    *   Giving it a more pronounced (e.g., darker, thicker) border.
    *   Increasing its width.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, upon careful comparison, there are no discernible visual changes to the search input field in the "after" image (second image) compared to the "before" image (first image). The border remains very subtle and light, and the width appears to be exactly the same.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts; the instruction appears to be entirely unimplemented. Both the border and the width of the search input field are identical in both images.

**Final verdict:**
