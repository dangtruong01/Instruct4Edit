Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the currently selected/active item within the main left navigation list visually stand out. The suggested method is to use a filled background color and bolder text. Given that the page content details "wpdm_dashboard_menu_actions," the most logical corresponding selected item in the "main left navigation list" would be "Filter Reference," as it is the parent category for this content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** In the "main left navigation list" (the menu on the far left), no item is visually highlighted or indicated as selected. The item "Filter Reference" appears as a regular, unstyled link.
    *   **After Image:** In the "main left navigation list," the item "Filter Reference" (nested under "Customization") is now distinctly highlighted with a solid blue background and white, visually bolder text. This clearly differentiates it from all other navigation items.
    *   Additionally, the specific content link "wpdm_dashboard_menu_actions" *within the page body* is also highlighted in the same manner. While this specific highlighting is not part of the "main left navigation list" as per the instruction, it does not negate the successful application of the instruction to the specified area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Ambiguity of "selected item":** In the "before" image, there is no explicit visual indication of a "selected item" in the left navigation. The instruction asks to make "the selected item... more clearly highlighted," which implies some form of selection was already present or known. However, by highlighting "Filter Reference" (the logical parent category of the current page content) with the requested styling, the spirit and core intent of the instruction have been met effectively.
    *   **Wording "more clearly":** Since no highlighting was present before, it's not "more clearly highlighted" but "now clearly highlighted." This is a minor semantic point and does not impact the visual implementation.
    *   **Extra highlighting:** The additional highlighting of "wpdm_dashboard_menu_actions" within the page content is beyond the scope of "main left navigation list," but it does not diminish the fact that the instruction *was* applied to an element *within* the main left navigation list.
