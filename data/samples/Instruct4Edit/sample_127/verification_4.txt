Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to increase the vertical empty space (whitespace) between distinct blocks of content, specifically referred to as "information and success boxes," located at the very bottom of the page. In this context, these likely refer to sections such as "Need More Clarification?", "Need Customization?", and potentially the long list under "Add Customization".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the change is not visible. Upon close comparison of the "before" and "after" images, especially the content at the bottom of the page (from "Not updated on Feb 21, 2017" downwards), there is no discernible difference in the amount of empty space between any of the text blocks, headings, or lists. The layout and spacing appear identical in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the intended change. However, the change itself is entirely missing from the "after" image. The instruction was not implemented visually.
