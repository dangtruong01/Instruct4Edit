Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction says to make the image take up the full width of its container. This means the image should stretch to the left and right edges of its containing block.
2. Comparing the two images, I don't see any noticeable change in the image's width. It appears to have the same width in both images.
3. The instruction is clear and there are no ambiguities. The change is not visible in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
