Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to tidy up the sidebar widgets and add visual separation between each section. This would likely involve adding lines, spacing, or backgrounds to distinguish the sections.
2. Comparing the two images, the sidebar widgets (located on the right side of the page) do not appear to have any additional visual separation in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
3. There are no lines, spacing, or background color changes. The sidebar appears identical in both images.

Final verdict:
