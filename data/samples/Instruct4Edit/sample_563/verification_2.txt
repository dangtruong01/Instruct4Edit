Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color of the navigation menu to a shade of blue that complements the header.
2. The navigation menu is at the very top of the image. In the original image, the navigation menu background color is green. In the modified image, the navigation menu background color is still green. The header area above the main title is also still the same green.
3. I do not see any changes to the navigation menu background color.

Final verdict:
