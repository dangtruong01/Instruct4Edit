Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to make the background of the sidebar labels slightly darker when hovering over them.
2. There is no way to visually assess hover states using static images. The images only depict a static state, not a hover state. Therefore, the instruction cannot be assessed.
3. The change can only be observed with an interactive component (hovering) which is not available here.

Final verdict:
