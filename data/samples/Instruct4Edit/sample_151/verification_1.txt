Here's my step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modify the main site title "Különféle online kaszinó játékok" located in the header. The desired changes are to increase its font-weight (make it bolder) and to remove any italic styling it currently has.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, the main site title "Különféle online kaszinó játékok" in the header remains unchanged.
    *   It still retains its italic style in the "after" image.
    *   It does not appear to be any bolder; its font-weight seems identical to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities; the instruction appears to have been entirely missed or not applied. Both parts of the instruction ("bolder" and "remove its italic style") are not reflected in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
