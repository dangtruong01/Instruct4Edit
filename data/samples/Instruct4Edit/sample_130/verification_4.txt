Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to enhance the 'Related Internet Celebrities' boxes by giving them more depth and visual separation. This was to be achieved by either applying a subtle drop shadow or a slightly thicker border to these boxes.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of the 'Related Internet Celebrities' boxes in both images:
*   **Border:** The border around each box (e.g., 'Indrak3', 'Abella Danger', 'Regina Ginera', etc.) appears to be the exact same thickness and color in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in border thickness.
*   **Drop Shadow:** I have meticulously searched for any subtle drop shadow effect around these boxes in the "after" image, but no such shadow is visible. The boxes remain flat against the background, just as they were in the "before" image.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts: neither a thicker border nor a drop shadow has been applied to the 'Related Internet Celebrities' boxes. The visual appearance of these boxes is identical in both images regarding depth and separation elements as described in the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
