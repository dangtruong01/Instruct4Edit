Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the size of the social media icons located at the bottom of the page. This is intended to improve their visibility and make them easier to click.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the Facebook and Twitter/X icons at the very bottom, under "Please tell your friends:", are relatively small. In the "after" image, these two icons are significantly larger, approximately doubling in their width and height.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is precisely applied to the specified elements (social media icons), at the specified location (bottom of the page), and achieves the intended visual effect (larger size for improved visibility). All applicable icons have been modified consistently.

**Final verdict:**
