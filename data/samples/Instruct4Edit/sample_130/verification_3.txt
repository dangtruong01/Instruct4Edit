Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for one of two things to be implemented:
    a. More vertical space *between* the blue title bar and the text content within each question and answer box.
    b. A clearer dividing line *between* the blue title bar and the text content within each question and answer box.
This refers to the separation between the blue horizontal bars (e.g., "How old is Bailey Nelson?") and the text directly below them (e.g., "Bailey Nelson was born on 17 September 2003.").

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, this change is not visible. Upon close inspection and comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is no additional vertical space added between any of the blue title bars and their corresponding text content. Neither is there any new or clearer dividing line introduced in these specific areas. The layout and spacing of these elements appear identical in both images.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the instruction itself, which is quite clear about the targeted area for change. The change simply appears to be missing.

**Final verdict:**
