Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the "Category" links in the right sidebar.
2. Looking at the right sidebar in the "after" image, the spacing between the category links (cloud, iaas, paas, hosting, swiss) appears to be identical to the spacing in the "before" image. There is no visible increase in spacing.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
