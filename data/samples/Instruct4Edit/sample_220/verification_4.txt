Here's the review of the design change:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase vertical spacing between distinct sections of the event description and its associated details (location, price, contact information). The goal is to improve readability by making these sections less "squished" and more clearly separated. This implies adding more line height or margin-bottom to paragraphs and list items that represent different pieces of information.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the changes are clearly visible and consistent with the instruction:
*   **Between the last paragraph of the main description and the "more information..." link:** There is a noticeable increase in vertical space after "Tickets are available..." and before "more information...".
*   **Between the "more information..." link and the event details block:** A significant amount of vertical space has been added between "more information..." and "Location:", creating a clear visual break.
*   **Within the event details block (Location, Price, Sponsor, Contact):** The vertical spacing between each detail line (e.g., between "Location:" and "Price:", "Price:" and "Sponsor:", "Sponsor:" and "Contact:") has been increased. This makes each piece of information stand out more distinctly.
*   **Between the Contact information and the "Share" section:** Additional vertical space has been introduced, further separating these logical content blocks.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was interpreted and applied effectively. The added vertical space successfully addresses the "squished together" feeling and enhances the readability of the event details.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
