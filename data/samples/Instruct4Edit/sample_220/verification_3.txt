Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the continuous, solid-colored bar containing navigation options ("Day," "Week," "Month," "Search," "Filter") into a series of distinct, individual button-like elements. Each navigation option should visually stand out as a separate button, rather than being part of a single block. Additionally, the text on these new buttons must remain easily legible, and no underlines should be present.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, "Day," "Week," "Month," "Search," and "Filter" are displayed within a single, continuous green rectangle.
    *   In the "after" image, each of these options ("Day," "Week," "Month," "Search," and "Filter") is now enclosed within its own separate, distinct rectangular shape, giving them a clear "button-like appearance." There is a slight visual gap or separation between them, making them individual elements.
    *   The text "Day," "Week," "Month," etc., remains white on a green background, maintaining its legibility, and there are no underlines present in either the "before" or "after" state.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no apparent doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements based on the given instruction and the visual comparison. The transformation from a solid bar to distinct button-like elements is evident, and the conditions regarding text legibility and lack of underlines are met. The "slightly distinct" nature of the buttons is also subjective but visually implemented in the "after" image.
