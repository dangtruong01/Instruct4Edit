Here's the comparison and justification:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modernize the small calendar on the left side. Specifically:
    *   Remove the "dated" corner images from the calendar's frame.
    *   Replace these with a "clean, modern border."
    *   Make the day numbers within the calendar "easier to read."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Corner images:** In the "before" image, the calendar box indeed has small, decorative elements in its top-left and top-right corners. In the "after" image, these corner elements are entirely absent.
    *   **Clean, modern border:** In place of the corner images and the previous border style, the "after" image displays a simple, clean, thin rectangular border around the calendar box. This clearly represents a "clean, modern border."
    *   **Easier to read day numbers:** When comparing the numbers (1 through 30) within the calendar grid, they are significantly larger and appear bolder in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. This makes them considerably easier to discern and read. The week numbers (W44, W45, etc.) also appear to have increased in size.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, all aspects of the instruction have been clearly and completely addressed in the "after" image. The dated corner elements are gone, a modern border is present, and the numbers are much more legible.

**Final verdict:**
