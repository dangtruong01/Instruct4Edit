Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests a subtle shadow effect to be added to the main title of the page, presumably "Kobkarn".
2. Visually comparing the two images, there is no discernible shadow effect added to the title "Kobkarn" in the 'after' image.
3. There is no visible change to the title between the two images. The instruction to add a subtle shadow appears not to have been implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
