Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the font size of the copyright text in the footer and center it.
2. In the 'after' image, the "Cookies Policy" text (likely the copyright text) appears to be the same size and not centered, as it was in the 'before' image.
3. It is not clear that the instruction was implemented.

Final verdict:
