1. The instruction is to change the color of the navigation bar to a lighter shade and improve text contrast. The navigation bar is the black bar with white text under the news headlines.
2. Comparing the two images, the navigation bar remains black. There is no change in color. The contrast between the text and the background remains the same.
3. The instruction has not been implemented.
