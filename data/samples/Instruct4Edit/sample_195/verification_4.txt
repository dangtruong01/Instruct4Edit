Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the news article and the sidebar. However, based on the images, there's no apparent sidebar visible. The most plausible place for a sidebar would be the black rectangle below the main news items at the top.
2. Comparing the two images, the horizontal spacing between the main news items at the top (the list of bullets) and the black rectangle below it seems unchanged.
3. There is no apparent increase in spacing. It's possible that the "sidebar" is not represented by the black rectangle as guessed and the instruction cannot be verified.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
