Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction "Create more visual separation" aims to visually distinguish the main article content from the comment section below it. This typically involves adding a distinct visual element such as a horizontal rule (line), increasing the vertical whitespace significantly between the two sections, or applying a different background color/box shadow to one of the sections to visually group its content and separate it from the other.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close comparison of the two images, specifically the area between the article's date/link ("19.09.2019 12:47 1093 Все Публикации") and the "Добавить ваш комментарий:" heading, there is no discernible visual difference. The spacing, background, and any potential separating elements (like lines or borders) appear identical in both the "before" and "after" images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction has not been implemented at all from a visual standpoint. No additional visual cues or increased spacing have been introduced to enhance the separation between the article content and the comment section.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
