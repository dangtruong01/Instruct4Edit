**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to transform existing text "Войти для представителей" located in the header into a prominent button with a contrasting background color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon careful review of the "before" image, the text "Войти для представителей" is not present anywhere in the header section. The header only contains the links "Новости", "Рейтинг МФО по отзывам", "Форумы", "Сотрудничество", and "Контакты". Since the target text does not exist in the original state, it cannot be "turned into" a button. Furthermore, no button or text "Войти для представителей" appears in the header of the "after" image either.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The core issue is that the element specified in the instruction ("Войти для представителей" text in the header) is entirely absent from the provided "before" image. Therefore, the instruction's premise (that this text exists and needs transformation) is unfulfilled, making it impossible to apply the instructed change.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
