Here's the detailed review:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing between the various input fields and their associated labels within the comment submission form. This means more empty space should be visible separating the "Text area", "Username", and "E-mail" input field groups, as well as the labels from their respective input elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   The vertical space between "Добавить ваш комментарий:" and the "Текст ответа" label has increased.
    *   The vertical space between the "Текст ответа" label and its corresponding text area has increased.
    *   Crucially, the vertical space between the large text area and the "Имя пользователя" input field group has significantly increased.
    *   The vertical space between the "Имя пользователя" label and its input field has increased.
    *   The vertical space between the "Имя пользователя" input field and the "E-mail (не публикуется)" input field group has significantly increased.
    *   The vertical space between the "E-mail (не публикуется)" label and its input field has increased.
    *   The vertical space between the "E-mail (не публикуется)" input field and the "Или авторизуйтесь через соц. сети:" section has also increased.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was clear about adding "more vertical spacing between the different input fields," and this has been consistently and noticeably applied across all relevant elements within the comment submission form. All elements that could be considered "input fields" or directly associated with them (like labels and surrounding form elements) have had their vertical separation increased.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
