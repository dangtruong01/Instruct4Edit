**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to "increase the space between the main image and the article title within the news section." This means adding more vertical whitespace between the bottom edge of the primary image (the large grey placeholder box at the top of the article content) and the top edge of the main article text (starting with the bold "Большая часть жителей России...").

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful visual comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the vertical space between the bottom of the main grey image placeholder and the top of the bold article text appears to be identical in both versions. There is no discernible increase in this specific spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts. The instruction was clear, and the visual comparison shows no change in the targeted spacing. The space remains the same as in the original image.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
