Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Reduce the horizontal space between the navigation menu items (presumably the links above the content and the search form (the "Search courses" field and the "Search" button) on the right side of the header.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the space does not appear to have been significantly reduced. The visual gap looks almost identical in both images.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not visually apparent.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
