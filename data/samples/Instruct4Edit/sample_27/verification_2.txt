Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction aims to introduce a pattern of alternating background colors for the rows of the table to improve readability.

2.  **Visibility:** The after image *does* show alternating background colors. The rows now have a light and a slightly darker shade, clearly distinguishing them.

3.  **Ambiguities/Missing Elements:** The implementation is clear.

Final verdict:
