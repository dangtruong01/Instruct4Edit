Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding around the video player within its container. This means there should be a visible gap between the video player's content (presumably the video itself, which is represented by a yellow box in the images) and the edges of its containing element (the yellowish-beige box surrounding it).
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any change in the amount of padding around the video player. The video player appears to be flush with the edges of its container in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself. The visual change is clear: to add space around the video player. The change is simply not present.

Final verdict:
