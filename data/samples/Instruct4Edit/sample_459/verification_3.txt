Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires increasing the font size of the category tags at the bottom and making them more visually prominent.
2. The category tags at the bottom in the "after" image are noticeably larger in font size compared to the "before" image. They also appear bolder and perhaps have a slight background or border to increase prominence.
3. There are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is clearly visible and matches the instruction.

Final verdict:
