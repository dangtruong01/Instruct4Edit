Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the background color of the page a bit lighter and less yellow. This means the overall background should appear whiter and less saturated with yellow.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any noticeable change in the background color. The "after" image appears to have the same background color as the "before" image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the requested change is not visually apparent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
