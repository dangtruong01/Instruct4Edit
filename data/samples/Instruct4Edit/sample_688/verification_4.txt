Here's my review based on the provided images:

**Instruction:** Make the "Log in" and "Register" buttons slightly rounded at the corners.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The intended visual change is to introduce a subtle curvature (rounding) to the sharp, 90-degree corners of both the "Log in" and "Register" buttons.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **"Log in" button:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the "Log in" button retains its sharp, square corners. There is no discernible rounding visible in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
    *   **"Register" button:** Similarly, in both the "before" and "after" images, the "Register" button also retains its sharp, square corners. No rounding is visible.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the absence of the change. The "after" image appears to be visually identical to the "before" image concerning the corners of the specified buttons. The instruction was not implemented visually.

**Final verdict:**
