Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction asks for two specific changes to the "My Account" heading text: make it larger and make it bolder.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Upon careful comparison, the "My Account" heading text in the "after" image appears to be identical in both size and font-weight (boldness) to the "before" image. There is no discernible visual difference.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts; the instruction appears to have not been implemented at all. Both parts of the instruction (larger and bolder) are clearly missing.

**Final verdict:**
