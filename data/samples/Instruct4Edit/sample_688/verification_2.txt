Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies increasing the horizontal space between the items within the main navigation menu. This means the gaps between "Home" and "Shop", "Shop" and "Services", "Services" and "About", "About" and "Contact", and "Contact" and "Login/Register" should be visibly wider in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the two images, the horizontal spacing between the main navigation menu items (Home, Shop, Services, About, Contact, Login/Register) appears to be **identical** in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in the gaps between these items.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction was to *increase* the space. Visually, no such increase has occurred. The layout and spacing of the navigation elements remain precisely the same in both versions.

**Final verdict:**
