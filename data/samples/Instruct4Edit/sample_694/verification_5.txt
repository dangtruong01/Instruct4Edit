**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction "Increase the readability of the disclaimer text at the very end of the article" implies visual changes that make the text easier to perceive and comprehend. Common ways to achieve this include:
    *   Increasing the font size.
    *   Increasing the contrast between the text and the background (e.g., making the text darker).
    *   Adjusting line height or letter spacing for better visual flow.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the changes are clearly visible:
    *   **Font Size:** In the "after" image, the disclaimer text (starting with "聲明：轉載此文...") is noticeably larger than in the "before" image.
    *   **Font Color/Contrast:** In the "after" image, the disclaimer text is significantly darker, almost black, providing much higher contrast against the white background compared to the light grey color in the "before" image.
    *   **Line Spacing:** The combination of larger font size and possibly adjusted line height also contributes to improved readability.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The visual modifications (increased font size and darker font color/improved contrast) directly and effectively contribute to increased readability as instructed. The change is clearly applied and complete for the specified element.

**Final verdict:**
