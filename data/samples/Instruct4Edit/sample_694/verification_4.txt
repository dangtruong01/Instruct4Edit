**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the "Previous article" and "Next article" elements at the bottom of the page from their current subtle state into more prominent and easily discoverable links. This involves:
    *   Making them visually identifiable as clickable links.
    *   Improving their visual alignment or relationship with the main article content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **From Text to Links:** In the "before" image, "上一篇：" (Previous article:) and "下一篇：" (Next article:) appear as plain text labels, offering no visual affordance of being interactive links. In the "after" image, these elements have been redesigned. The actual navigation text ("上一篇" and "下一篇") along with a placeholder title ("[文章标题示例]") are now displayed in blue and are underlined, which are standard visual cues for clickable links on the web.
    *   **Easier to Find:** This transformation into clearly marked links (blue, underlined) makes them significantly easier to find and identify as interactive elements compared to their previous plain text appearance. The addition of the placeholder article title also adds more visual weight and context to the lines, further enhancing discoverability.
    *   **Alignment:** The new links maintain the same left alignment as the main article content block, ensuring horizontal consistency with the page's primary content flow. While they are still positioned at the very bottom of the page (after the source information and disclaimer), their visual treatment as standard links aligns them better with common UI patterns and user expectations for navigation elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The phrase "align better with the main content" can be interpreted in several ways. While the horizontal alignment is consistent with the content column, one might argue that "better alignment" could also imply a closer vertical proximity or more integrated grouping with the *end* of the actual article content, rather than being positioned below other elements like the source and disclaimer at the very bottom of the page. However, the instruction does not specify vertical positioning or explicit integration into the article's body. The current implementation does align them horizontally with the content block and visually aligns them better with typical interactive elements in a UI. The primary and most critical part of the instruction, "easier to find" (by making them proper links), is unequivocally met.
