As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I will now compare the two images based on your instruction.

---

**Instruction:** Widen the main article text area, reducing the large empty spaces on the left and right sides.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the horizontal width of the primary content block containing the article title, main text body, source information, and any embedded images or captions related to the article. This widening should result in a noticeable reduction of the white space (margins) currently present on both the left and right sides of this content block.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the main article text area (including the title, date/source, article paragraphs, image captions, and the "资料来源" section) occupies a narrower column with substantial empty space on its left and right.
    *   In the "after" image, the same content elements are noticeably wider. The text lines are longer, fitting more characters per line, and the images have also expanded horizontally to match the new width. Consequently, the white space on both the left and right sides of the main article content has been significantly reduced.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No significant doubts or ambiguities.
    *   The instruction to "widen the main article text area" has been applied comprehensively to all elements that constitute the "main article," including the title, metadata, body paragraphs, and inline images/captions.
    *   The "reducing the large empty spaces on the left and right sides" is also effectively achieved as a direct consequence of widening the content area. The spaces are indeed reduced, not entirely eliminated, which aligns with typical web design practices for readability.
    *   Elements outside the "main article text area," such as the top breadcrumb navigation ("您的位置") and the bottom navigation links ("上一篇," "下一篇"), have appropriately remained unchanged, indicating a focused application of the instruction.

**Final verdict:** ✅ Fully Applied
