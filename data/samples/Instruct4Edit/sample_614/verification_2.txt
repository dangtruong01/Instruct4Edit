Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the filter options in the "search-results" section. Since there is no visible "search-results" section, the area the task refers to is the filter section. Thus, the intention is to add more vertical space between the filter options like "Activités courtes", "Hors classe", etc.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no visible difference in the spacing between the filter options.
3. The instruction is clear, but the change is not visible in the provided images.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
