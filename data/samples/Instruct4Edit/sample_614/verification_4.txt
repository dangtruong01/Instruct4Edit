Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the breadcrumbs' font color to a darker grey. Breadcrumbs are not immediately visible in the image, but given the context, they likely refer to the navigation links near the top of the page, specifically the "Aller au contenu principal" link.
2. Visually comparing the "before" and "after" images, the color of "Aller au contenu principal" appears to be the same shade of grey. There is no noticeable darkening.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but there is no apparent change to the breadcrumbs.

Final verdict:
