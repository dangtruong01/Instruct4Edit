Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the navigation links in the header more prominent by increasing their font size or adding a background color on hover.
2. I see no visual change in the navigation links between the "before" and "after" images. The font size is the same, and there is no hover effect visible.
3. There are no visual changes related to the instruction in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
