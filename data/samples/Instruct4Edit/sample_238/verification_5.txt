As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I must assess the provided images against the given instruction.

**Instruction:** Ensure the entire page layout fluidly adjusts and looks good on different screen sizes, from large monitors down to smaller devices like tablets and phones.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction describes the implementation of a responsive web design. This means the layout of the page (content arrangement, element sizes, spacing, navigation, etc.) should adapt dynamically and gracefully to various viewport widths and heights, ensuring optimal readability and usability across a wide range of devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, smartphones) without requiring horizontal scrolling or appearing broken.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is **not** clearly visible. Both the "before" and "after" images appear to be static screenshots taken at what seems to be the *exact same desktop-sized viewport*. There are no visual differences in the core layout, column structure, font scaling, or element rearrangement that would indicate responsiveness or fluid adjustment across *different* screen sizes. The only discernible changes are minor text edits within the content (e.g., "Home" to "Inicio", capitalization of "TarotdelosSecretos.com") and a slight adjustment in the footer's font size and possibly line-height. These minor textual and styling tweaks do not demonstrate the "fluid adjustment" or "looking good on different screen sizes" that the instruction specifically asks for.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements. To verify the instruction fully, one would need:
    *   Multiple screenshots of the "after" page rendered at **different, distinct screen sizes** (e.g., desktop, a typical tablet portrait, a typical mobile portrait view).
    *   Alternatively, a video demonstrating the page's layout adapting as the browser window is resized.
    *   The provided images, being only two static screenshots of seemingly the same viewport, offer no visual evidence whatsoever regarding the page's ability to "fluidly adjust" or "look good on different screen sizes." It is impossible to confirm the instruction's core requirement based solely on the visual information given.
