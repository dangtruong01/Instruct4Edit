Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the visual separation and readability of each individual search result entry. This implies adding visual cues (like borders, increased spacing, or background differentiation) to clearly delineate where one search result ends and the next begins, making it easier for the user's eye to distinguish them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    In the "before" image, the search results flow almost continuously, with only the default line spacing separating them. It's difficult to visually group each full result.
    In the "after" image, a thin, light gray horizontal line has been added both above and below each individual search result entry. This effectively frames each result within a distinct visual box, clearly separating it from the preceding and succeeding entries. For example, the entry starting with "Esoterismo..." is now clearly bordered at its top and bottom, as is "Tarot Madrid...", and so on for all results.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The implementation is straightforward and directly addresses the instruction. The added lines provide excellent visual separation, which in turn enhances the readability by making it easier to identify and parse individual result entries. The change is subtle enough not to be distracting but effective in achieving the goal.
