Here's my review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the existing page number selection (pagination) at the bottom of the page from its current basic, text-based appearance to a more modern, user-friendly, and visually distinct set of controls. Specifically, it intends to make individual page numbers and navigation links easier to click by potentially increasing their size and spacing, and to provide a much clearer visual cue for the currently selected page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the changes are clearly visible and significant:
    *   **Redesign:** The plain text links (`1`, `[2]`, `3`, `[4]` etc.) in the "before" image have been redesigned into distinct, rectangular button-like elements with borders and a background color in the "after" image.
    *   **More contemporary:** The new design with distinct button-like elements, consistent styling, and clear visual hierarchy (for the active page) appears much more modern and clean compared to the simple bracketed text in the "before" image.
    *   **Easier to click:** The individual page numbers and navigation links (`< Página Anterior`, `Próxima Página >`) now occupy a larger, defined clickable area (visually implied by the button styling) and have increased spacing between them. This visually suggests they are easier to target and click than the tightly packed, small text links previously.
    *   **Clearer indication of the current page:** In the "before" image, the current page was ambiguously indicated by square brackets (`[2]`, `[4]`). In the "after" image, the current page (`2`) is highlighted with a solid green background and white text, making its active status immediately and unequivocally clear. This is a significant improvement in clarity.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Based purely on the visual changes and the given instruction, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. All aspects of the instruction ("more contemporary," "easier to click," "clearer indication of the current page," and "redesign") have been clearly addressed and implemented in the modified image.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
