Here's the review of the design change:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to give the primary navigation links at the top of the page a more contemporary and structured appearance. This involves moving beyond plain text links, possibly by applying distinct visual styling (like button-like elements, background colors, or borders) to each link, or by physically grouping related links together to enhance organization and modernity.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the navigation links (e.g., "Home", "Añade tu web", and "Tarot Reading", "Carta Astral") are simple, plain blue text links with default styling. In the "after" image, these links have been transformed into visually distinct, button-like elements. Each link now features a light background, a border, and darker text, making them stand out as interactive elements rather than just text. This consistent visual treatment is applied to all navigation links in both the main and secondary top rows, contributing significantly to a more organized and modern look.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction provided two possible approaches ("grouping related links" *or* "using distinct visual elements"). The design clearly and effectively implemented the "using distinct visual elements" approach by styling each navigation link as a distinct button. While explicit sub-grouping (e.g., putting several related links within a single larger container) was not performed, the uniform styling of all navigational items inherently organizes them as a coherent set of primary navigation, fulfilling the spirit of the instruction for a more "organized" and "modern" look.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
