Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase spacing around the job posting title to give it more visual breathing room. This means increasing the margin or padding above, below, left, and right of the title.
2. Visually comparing the two images, there is no perceivable change in the spacing around the job posting title. The title appears to have the same amount of spacing around it in both the before and after images.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
