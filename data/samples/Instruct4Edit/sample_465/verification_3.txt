Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the horizontal menu with "FAQ", "Calendar", and "Mark Forums Read" to have a slightly lighter background color.
2. Comparing the before and after images, I cannot visually detect any difference in the background color of that specific menu. The color appears the same in both images.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction. The target area is clearly defined, and the desired change (lighter background color) is also clear. However, there is no visual change.

Final verdict:
