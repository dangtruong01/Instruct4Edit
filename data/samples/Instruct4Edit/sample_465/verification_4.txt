Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add spacing between the list items in the "You are not logged in" message.
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the list items within the "You are not logged in" message appears to be the same. There is no visible increase in spacing.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction appears to not have been implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
