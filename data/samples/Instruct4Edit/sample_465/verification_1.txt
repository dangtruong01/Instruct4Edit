Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding around the logo in the top-left corner. This means increasing the space between the logo and the edges of its container (if any) or the edges of the screen.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any difference in the spacing around the logo in the top-left corner. The logo still appears to be flush with the top and left edges of its container (or the screen edge if it has no container).
3. There is no visible change in the padding around the logo.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
