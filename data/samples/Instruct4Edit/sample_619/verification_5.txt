Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction asks to change the navigation menu items from horizontal to vertical arrangement on smaller screens. This would involve the menu items stacking on top of each other rather than being side-by-side.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The navigation items appear to be in the same horizontal arrangement in both images. There is no visual difference.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the requested visual change is entirely missing in the modified image. The navigation menu items do not stack vertically.

Final verdict:
