Here's my analysis of the visual changes:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to increase the whitespace (padding or margin) around images within the blog post content. This should create more separation between the images and the surrounding text, making the text wrapping appear less cramped and giving the images more "breathing room."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is visible, though subtly in some areas, upon close comparison:
    *   **For the large image at the top-left:** In the "after" image, there is a clear and visible increase in the horizontal space between the right edge of the image and the start of the wrapping text ("Summer is in full swing..."). The text in the "after" image starts noticeably further to the right. Additionally, the vertical space between the bottom of this image and the "Summer Baseball Games" heading below it also appears to have increased, providing more vertical breathing room.
    *   **For the small, light-colored image within the paragraph:** While more subtle, the text wrapping around this image has also changed in the "after" image. The lines of text to its right are pushed slightly further away, and the text below it also shows a minor increase in separation, indicating that some additional spacing has been applied around this image as well. The overall effect is a slightly less cluttered wrap.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The main potential doubt is whether the added "breathing room" is deemed "distinct" enough for the smaller image, as the change there is less pronounced than for the larger image. However, the instruction was to "Adjust the spacing" to "ensure" these outcomes. An adjustment *was* made, resulting in *more* breathing room and *cleaner* wrapping than before, even if the degree of change for the small image is minimal. The instruction does not specify a minimum amount of "distinctness," only that it should be ensured. No elements are missing from the implementation; it's a matter of the degree of application.

**Final verdict:**
