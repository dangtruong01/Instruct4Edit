Here's the step-by-step justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for two main visual changes to *all* "Reserve Now" buttons across the site:
    *   A consistent, brighter color.
    *   A subtle rounded edge.
The overall goal is to make them more noticeable and clickable.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**

*   **Identification of "Reserve Now" elements in "Before" image:**
    *   There is a text link "Reserve Now" under the "Return to Content" section (black text, appears clickable).
    *   There is another text link "Reserve Now" under "Make Your Stay An Experience" (blue, underlined text, typical hyperlink style).
    *   Crucially, there are no elements that visually appear as distinct "buttons" with background colors or borders in the "before" image. The instruction implies that these links should *become* buttons and then be styled.

*   **Identification of "Reserve Now" elements and their changes in "After" image:**
    *   The "Reserve Now" link under "Return to Content" has been transformed into a distinct button. It now has a bright, yellow/gold background color, which is clearly brighter than the surrounding text and gives it prominence. It also clearly has subtle rounded corners. This specific instance *fully* meets the criteria.
    *   However, the "Reserve Now" link under "Make Your Stay An Experience" (which was a blue, underlined text link in the "before" image) remains a blue, underlined text link in the "after" image. It has *not* been converted into a button, nor has it received the brighter color or rounded edge.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**

*   **Ambiguity of "buttons":** While the instruction says "buttons", and the "before" image had no *visual* buttons, the clear intent is that the "Reserve Now" calls to action should be styled as such. The design team correctly interpreted this for one instance.
*   **Missing/Partial Implementation:** The instruction specifically stated "Make *all* 'Reserve Now' buttons across the site a consistent..." This implies that every instance of "Reserve Now" that functions as a call to action should receive the specified styling and transformation into a button. This was demonstrably not done, as the "Reserve Now" link under "Make Your Stay An Experience" was entirely overlooked. This represents a significant failure in consistency and completeness.
