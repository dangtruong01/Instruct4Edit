Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to increase the boldness (weight) of the text in the navigation menu items (Home, Features, etc.).
2. Comparing the "after" image to the "before" image, it is difficult to tell if the text is slightly bolder.
3. There is some ambiguity. It's challenging to confidently detect a slight change in boldness without precise visual comparison tools.

Final verdict:
