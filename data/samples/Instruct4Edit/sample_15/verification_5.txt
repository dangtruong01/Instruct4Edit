❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to increase the width of the search bar within the sidebar.
2. There is no search bar in the sidebar in either the before or after image.
3. Because there is no search bar, the instruction can't be correctly applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
