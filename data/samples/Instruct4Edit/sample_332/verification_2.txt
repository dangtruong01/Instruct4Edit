Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the primary play button for the featured episode (the one at the top, associated with "Beata Górka-Winter") significantly larger and more visually distinct. Specific suggestions for achieving this include using a clear background color and a more prominent play icon.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Identification of the button:** In the "before" image, the main play button is a subtle text link labeled "Play • 32 min" with a small, unhighlighted play icon to its left.
    *   **Size and Visual Distinction:** In the "after" image, this element has been transformed into a prominent, circular blue button. This button is visibly larger than the original text link and stands out significantly due to its shape and solid color background.
    *   **Clear background color:** The button now has a clear, solid blue background color, which was explicitly suggested in the instruction.
    *   **More prominent play icon:** The play icon inside the blue circle is now white, larger, and centered, making it much more prominent and easily recognizable compared to the small, subtle icon in the "before" image. The "32 min" text has been removed from the immediate button area, shifting focus entirely to the play icon and button itself.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The transformation is very direct and fully addresses every aspect of the instruction. The button is clearly larger, more visually distinct (with a new background color), and features a more prominent play icon.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
