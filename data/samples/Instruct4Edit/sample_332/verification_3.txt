As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, here is my assessment:

**Instruction:** Add a subtle border or card-like background to each individual episode listing in the "More episodes" section to clearly separate them.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to enhance the visual distinction between individual episode listings within the "More episodes" section. This was to be achieved by either enclosing each listing within a subtle border or by giving it a distinct card-like background, thereby making each episode a separate visual entity.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The "More episodes" section displays episode listings as plain text blocks, separated only by vertical spacing. There is no background or border defining each individual listing.
    *   **After Image:** Each episode listing within the "More episodes" section now clearly has a light gray background fill and a subtle, thin border (appears to be 1px, light gray). This treatment effectively creates distinct "cards" for each episode. The change is very clear and immediately noticeable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction provided an "or" condition ("subtle border *or* card-like background"). The design implemented *both* a subtle border *and* a card-like background. This not only meets the requirement but potentially enhances the clarity of separation even further, without being visually heavy or distracting.
    *   The chosen colors for the background and border are indeed "subtle," ensuring they clearly separate the elements without overpowering the content.
    *   The change has been applied consistently to all visible episode listings in the specified section.
