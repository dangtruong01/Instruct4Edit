Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the border-radius of the "Sign in" button located in the top right corner, making its corners appear perceptibly more rounded.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "Sign in" button in both the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible visual difference in the rounding of its corners. The button appears identical in both states, maintaining the same level of subtle rounding, if any. There is no visible increase in its rounded appearance.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is a significant doubt that any change was applied at all. The instruction specified "slightly more rounded," which implies a noticeable, albeit minor, alteration. No such alteration is visible. The "after" image looks identical to the "before" image regarding this specific element.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
