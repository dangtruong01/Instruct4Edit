**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the blank vertical space separating the main episode's entire content block (which includes its description, support links, and sponsor information) from the "More episodes" heading below it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the space between the last line of the main episode's content ("Devtalents https://devtalents.com") and the "More episodes from Układ Otwarty. Igor Janke zaprasza" heading is relatively small. In the "after" image, this vertical gap has been significantly increased, pushing the "More episodes" heading further down the page and creating more breathing room.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is exactly as instructed and clearly implemented. The intended separation has been achieved.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
