Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to enhance the visual prominence of images within the article content, especially those with captions. This is to be achieved by:
    *   Adding "breathing room" (increased spacing) around them.
    *   Optionally adding a "very subtle border or shadow effect" to further differentiate them from the text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Breathing Room:** Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, all three images within the main content area (including the one with the caption "Автор данного правдивого отзыва..." and the one with "C-Crypto - это ШУЛЕРА !!! СКАМ !!!") now have significantly more vertical space above and below them, separating them from the surrounding text. This effectively adds "breathing room."
    *   **Border/Shadow Effect:** Yes, a subtle grey border has been applied to all three images in the "after" image. This fulfills the "perhaps a very subtle border or shadow effect" part of the instruction. The borders are indeed subtle and do not overpower the image content or article design.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    None. The instruction was quite specific, and both core aspects (breathing room and subtle visual effect) have been consistently applied to all relevant images throughout the main article body. The changes are clear, effective, and align perfectly with the "visual prominence" goal.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
