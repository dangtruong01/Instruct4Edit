Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to significantly enhance the visual impact of the primary heading "C-Crypto - МОШЕННИКИ !!! SCAM !!!". This involves two specific actions:
    *   Making the heading text *larger* in font size.
    *   Ensuring the heading's color *contrasts well* with its background to make it immediately noticeable.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**

*   **Larger Font Size:** Yes, this change is very clearly visible. In the "after" image, the heading "C-Crypto - МОШЕННИКИ !!! SCAM !!!" is substantially larger than in the "before" image. Its increased scale makes it much more prominent on the page.
*   **Color Contrast:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the heading text is black on a white background. This combination inherently provides excellent contrast. The instruction "ensuring its color contrasts well" implies either changing the color if contrast is poor, or confirming that existing contrast is good. Since black on white is a high-contrast pairing, this part of the instruction is met by retaining the existing, well-contrasting color. The enlarged size, combined with this high contrast, effectively draws immediate attention.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction's wording "ensuring its color contrasts well" could be misconstrued to mean a *change* in color was required. However, given that the original black text on a white background already provides high contrast, retaining this color while increasing size fulfills the intent of drawing immediate attention through improved visual impact. Had the original contrast been poor, a color change would have been mandatory. In this case, the existing color already meets the contrast requirement.

**Final verdict:**
