**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reduce the horizontal width of the central content column, thereby increasing the white space (margins/padding) on both the left and right sides of this column. This should make the page feel less crowded or "cramped" horizontally.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the main content blocks, including text paragraphs and the embedded images, occupy a noticeably narrower horizontal space compared to the "before" image. This results in wider margins on the left and right sides of the content, exactly as instructed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. The central content column has been effectively narrowed, leading to an increase in the horizontal spacing on both sides. The visual result perfectly matches the instruction's intent.

**Final verdict:**
