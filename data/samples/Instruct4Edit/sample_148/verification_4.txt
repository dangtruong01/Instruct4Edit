**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the currently unstructured block of contact email addresses at the bottom of the page into a clearly organized list. This involves introducing visual separation (like line breaks) and potentially list markers (like bullet points) to improve readability and make individual contact information easier to identify.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the email addresses and their descriptions form a dense, wrapped paragraph. In the "after" image, each email entry (e.g., `[email protected] (генеральные письма жалоб на адрес компании, Горбач Нина)`) is now placed on its own distinct line and is preceded by a clear black bullet point. This significantly enhances the visual structure and readability of the contact information.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no apparent doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifically suggested "bullet points or clearer line breaks," and the "after" image effectively implements both, turning the block of text into a well-defined bulleted list. All email entries identified in the "before" image are now properly formatted as list items in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
