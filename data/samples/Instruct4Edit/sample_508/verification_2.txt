Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between forum categories (e.g., "Admin", "FTN95", "FTN77"). This should create more visual separation between these sections.
2. Comparing the two images, I can see that there is indeed more vertical space between the "Admin" and "FTN95" categories in the second image compared to the first. Similarly, the space between "FTN95" and "FTN77" is also increased.
3. I do not see any ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clear and consistent with the instruction.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
