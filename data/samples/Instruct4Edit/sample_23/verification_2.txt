Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the space between each podcast episode listing. This means there should be a larger gap between the elements representing each episode (e.g., the episode number, title, and description).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the vertical space between the episode listings has been increased. The before image shows a tighter grouping of episodes. The after image exhibits more separation between episodes.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
