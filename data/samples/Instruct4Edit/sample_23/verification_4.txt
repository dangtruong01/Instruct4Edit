Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to add a "subtle shadow effect" to each episode list item. This should provide a sense of depth by making the items appear slightly raised or separated from the background.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The "after" image does not visually demonstrate a subtle shadow effect on the episode list items when compared to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the shadow effect is not visibly present.

Final verdict:
