Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a small margin to be added around the footer to visually separate it from the main content. This implies adding space (padding or margin) on all sides of the footer section.
2. Comparing the two images, it's difficult to tell if any margin has been applied around the footer, it appears to be in the exact same position.
3. Visually, it's unclear whether any margin has been added around the footer. It is hard to see any gaps being added.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
