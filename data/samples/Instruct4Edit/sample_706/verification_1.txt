Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to darken the background color of the top header where the phone and email info are displayed.
2. Comparing the two images, the background color of the top header in the second image is visually similar to the first image. There is no noticeable darkening.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change does not seem to have been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
