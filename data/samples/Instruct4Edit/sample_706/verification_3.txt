Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the menu text to a darker gray. The menu text is the list of items under "St Andrews URC Walton on Thames".
2. Comparing the two images, the menu text does appear to be a slightly darker shade of gray in the "after" image. It is subtly but visibly darker.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements based on the instruction.

Final verdict:
