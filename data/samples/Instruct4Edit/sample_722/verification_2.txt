Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for increased spacing between the navigation links in the header. This means adding more horizontal space between the words "Inicio", "Series", "Bio", "Publicaciones", "Blog", "Talleres", and "Contacto" in the header.
2. Visually comparing the "before" and "after" images, the space between the navigation links appears to be increased.
3. There are no immediately apparent doubts or ambiguities.

Final verdict:
