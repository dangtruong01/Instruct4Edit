Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border at the bottom of the header. The header is the section containing "ANDONI EUBA" and the links.
2. Comparing the two images, there is indeed a very thin, light grey border added to the bottom of the header in the "after" image. It's subtle but present.
3. There are no ambiguities, the change is present.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
