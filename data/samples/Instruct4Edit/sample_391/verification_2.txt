Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation links in the right sidebar more modern and visually appealing. This is a broad instruction with room for interpretation, but ideally, it would involve changes to font, color, spacing, icons, or overall style to make the links look more up-to-date.
2. Comparing the two images, the right sidebar navigation links ("Новости", "Информаторий", "Галерея", "Законы", "Файлы", "Блог") in the "after" image have a distinct background color, and the font appears slightly bolder. This is a clear visual change from the "before" image.
3. While the instruction is subjective, the changes made are visible and address the general intent. There are no missing elements.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
