Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the boxes in the right sidebar (presumably the "Menu сайта," "Профиль," and "Статистика" boxes).
2. Visually comparing the two images, I cannot detect any shadows added to the boxes in the right sidebar in the after image compared to the before image.
3. There are no apparent shadows, making the implementation doubtful.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
