Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the font of the blog post excerpts a little bigger to improve readability. The blog post excerpts are the text under "Evaluating Arguments on LR" and "Examples of Sufficient vs. Necessary".
2. When comparing the two images, it is difficult to discern a noticeable difference in the font size of the blog post excerpts. The change, if any, is too subtle to be clearly visible.
3. There is ambiguity regarding the specific elements within the blog post excerpt that should have increased in size, and the change is not readily apparent.
