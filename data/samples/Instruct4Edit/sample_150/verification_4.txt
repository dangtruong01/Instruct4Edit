Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to upgrade the visual quality of specific icons. It stated to "Replace the small, pixellated icons next to links like 'FAQ', 'Search', and 'Memberslist' with modern, higher-resolution alternatives." This implies that new, better-quality icons should be present in the 'after' image, taking the place of the old ones.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In the 'before' image, small icons are clearly visible next to the navigation links 'FAQ', 'Suchen' (Search), 'Mitgliederliste' (Memberslist), 'Profil' (Profile), 'Registrieren' (Register), and 'Login'.
    In the 'after' image, *all* of these icons are completely absent. They have been removed entirely, rather than being replaced by new, higher-resolution versions.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant discrepancy. The instruction was to "replace" the icons, which means putting new ones in their place. However, the 'after' image shows that the icons have been *removed* altogether. This is not a replacement but a deletion. Therefore, the core of the instruction – to provide modern, higher-resolution *alternatives* – has not been met.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
