Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to achieve two main visual changes for the "copyright and powered-by text" block located at the very bottom of the page:
    *   **Horizontal Centering:** The entire text block should be moved from its initial left-aligned position to be horizontally centered on the page.
    *   **Generous Vertical Spacing:** Ample empty vertical space should be added around this text block, particularly above it, to prevent it from appearing cramped or directly adjacent to the elements above.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Horizontal Centering:** In the "before" image, the "Powered by phpBB..." and "Deutsche bereitstellung von phpBB.de" text is clearly left-aligned at the bottom. In the "after" image, this entire text block (now formatted with different line breaks for "powered by", "phpBB", and the copyright info) is distinctly positioned in the horizontal center of the page. This change is clearly visible.
    *   **Generous Vertical Spacing:** In the "before" image, the text is immediately below the "Gehe zu:" dropdown menu. In the "after" image, a substantial amount of empty vertical space has been introduced between the "Gehe zu:" element and the "powered by" text block. This visibly fulfills the requirement for "generous vertical spacing" above the text. As the text is at the very bottom, spacing "around it" primarily refers to the space above it within the content flow.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction primarily concerns the visual placement and spacing. While the internal formatting of the "powered by" and copyright text (e.g., line breaks) has changed in the "after" image, this change facilitates the centering and does not contradict the core instruction. The target elements (copyright and powered-by text) are still clearly identifiable, centered, and have generous vertical spacing above them. There are no doubts regarding the implementation of the specified visual changes.
