**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to update the visual style of the main profile table by:
    a. Softening the borders between cells.
    b. Using a more cohesive and less contrasting color scheme for the rows and headers.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the changes are clearly visible:
    a. **Softer Borders:**
        *   The horizontal borders within the "Kontakt Walter" section (e.g., between E-Mail, Adresse, Nachricht) are noticeably lighter and less prominent in the "after" image compared to the "before" image, where they were dark gray lines.
        *   The vertical borders separating the left "label" column (e.g., "Avatar", "Kontakt Walter") from the right "content" column are also lighter and softer.
        *   The overall outer border of the main profile table also appears slightly lighter and less stark.
    b. **More Cohesive and Less Contrasting Color Scheme:**
        *   The header "Profil anzeigen: Walter" has changed from a dark gray to a medium blue-gray, which feels less stark against the rest of the table.
        *   The background colors of the "Avatar" and "Kontakt Walter" label cells have changed from a distinct dark beige/brown to a lighter, more desaturated beige-gray, significantly reducing the contrast with the white content areas.
        *   The background color of the "Alles über Walter" content area has also shifted from a light yellow-beige to a much lighter, almost off-white or very light beige, making it blend more cohesively with the new muted tones.
        *   Overall, the color transitions between different sections and cells are much smoother, and the palette is less contrasting.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. All aspects of the instruction were addressed: the "main profile table" was targeted, "borders between cells" were softened, and a "more cohesive and less contrasting color scheme for the rows and headers" was implemented effectively. The changes are precise and align perfectly with the instruction.
