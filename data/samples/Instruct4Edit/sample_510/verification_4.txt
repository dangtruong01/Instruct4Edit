Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to widen the "Forum Jump" dropdown to prevent text wrapping.
2. Comparing the two images, the width of the "Forum Jump" dropdown appears to be visually identical. The text inside the dropdown does not appear to wrap in either image.
3. There is no visible change in the width of the "Forum Jump" dropdown in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

Final verdict:
