Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a light gray border to the username and password input boxes.
2. Comparing the two images, the input boxes for username and password do not appear to have a noticeable light gray border added in the 'after' image. They look the same as in the 'before' image.
3. There is no visible change that matches the instruction.

Final verdict:
