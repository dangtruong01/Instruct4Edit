Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color to a lighter, more modern shade of beige or off-white.
2. Visually, I cannot see any change in the background color between the two images. The background appears to be the same in both images.
3. There is no visible difference in the background color, so the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
