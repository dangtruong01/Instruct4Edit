Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction refers to the two images on the right side of the header. The expected change is to arrange these images vertically in a single column instead of horizontally.
2. Comparing the images, I cannot see any difference in the position or arrangement of the images in the header.
3. There are no visible changes, so the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
