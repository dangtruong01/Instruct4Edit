Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the navigation menu items when hovering over them. Since there is no hover state shown in the image, it is impossible to determine if a shadow was added.
2. Without seeing the hover state, I cannot confirm if the shadow was added.
3. The missing hover state is the main ambiguity.
