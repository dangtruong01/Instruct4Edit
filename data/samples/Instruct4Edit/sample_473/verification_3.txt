Explanation:
The instruction states that the chat widget should be initially hidden. However, comparing the two images, there is no visual difference. The chat widget is not visible in either image, suggesting it was never present or visible in the first place. Therefore, the instruction to initially hide it hasn't resulted in any discernible visual change. There's no indication of a button to trigger the widget or any delay mechanism being implemented.
