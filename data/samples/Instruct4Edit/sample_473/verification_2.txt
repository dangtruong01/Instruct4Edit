Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the video container. This means that there should be a slightly darker area around the container, giving the impression that it is floating above the background.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any change whatsoever regarding shadows around the video container.
3. I have no doubt that the change has not been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
