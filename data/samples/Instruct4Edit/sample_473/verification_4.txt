Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the horizontal rule in the footer to a thinner, lighter gray line. This means both the thickness and the color of the line should be modified.
2. Looking at the provided images, the horizontal rule above "Контактная информация официального интернет-сайта forexgand.com" appears to be the relevant line in the footer. Visually, it is difficult to confirm if the line has been changed to a thinner and lighter gray in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. The difference, if any, is very subtle.
3. Due to the subtle and potentially subjective nature of the change, there's a degree of uncertainty in confirming whether the instruction has been applied completely.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
