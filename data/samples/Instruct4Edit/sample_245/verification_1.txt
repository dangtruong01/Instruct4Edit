**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that the text color of the main navigation links should be changed to match the primary blue color of the site. Based on the "before" image, the main navigation links are identified as "更多", "帮助", and "Blog" located in the top right corner. The primary blue color of the site is exemplified by elements like the "立即轉換" button or the "点击选择文件" text. Therefore, the intended change is for "更多", "帮助", and "Blog" to turn blue.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. In the "before" image, the text "更多", "帮助", and "Blog" is dark (appears black or a very dark gray). In the "after" image, the text color of these same navigation links remains unchanged; they are still dark (black/very dark gray). There is no visible shift to the primary blue color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the identification of the main navigation links or the primary blue color. The instruction was clear. However, the instructed visual change (text color change to blue) has not been implemented at all for the specified elements in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
