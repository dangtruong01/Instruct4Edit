Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding to the top and bottom of the footer section.
2. By visually comparing the two images, it appears that some padding has been added to the bottom of the content and the footer section starts a bit further down. However, I don't see any padding added to the *top* of the footer section.
3. The instruction was to add padding to *both* the top and bottom of the footer. The bottom padding seems to be there, but the top padding appears missing.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
