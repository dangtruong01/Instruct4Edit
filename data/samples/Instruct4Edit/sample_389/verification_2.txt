**Step-by-step justification:**
1. The instruction requests rounded corners and subtle shadows to be added to the search input fields.
2. I cannot find any search input fields in the images. This could be due to the images displaying a landing page or video results, rather than a search page. Therefore, the design change could not have been applied as intended.
3. The instruction itself is not faulty, but the lack of search input fields in the images makes its implementation impossible.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
