Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the video thumbnails. This means the gaps between the boxes containing video thumbnails should be larger in the "after" image.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to notice any difference in the spacing between the thumbnails. The thumbnails appear to be spaced as closely as before.
3. Due to the limited resolution of the images, it's hard to accurately estimate the margin change but if the change was significant, it would be noticeable. It is difficult to assess whether any change in spacing has been implemented.

Final verdict:
