Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests making video titles more prominent and easier to read by increasing font size or adding a background.
2. Visually, there's no obvious change in font size or a background added to the titles in the second image compared to the first.
3. The instruction is clear, but the change isn't visible.

Final verdict:
