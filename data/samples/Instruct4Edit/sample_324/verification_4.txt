**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests the addition of a "thin, light gray border" around "each distinct section within the right-hand sidebar," providing "Recent Posts" and "Recent Comments" as examples. The purpose is to "clearly separate them."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Right-hand sidebar sections identified in 'before' image:** The 'Recent Posts' section (including its title and list of posts) and the 'Recent Comments' section (including its title). There is also a large, empty white box above 'Recent Posts' that appears to be part of this sidebar area.
    *   **Borders in 'after' image:**
        *   A very thin, light gray border has been added around the entire 'Recent Posts' section, encompassing both its title and the list of posts.
        *   A very thin, light gray border has been added around the 'Recent Comments' section, encapsulating its title.
        *   A similar thin, light gray border has also been added around the large, empty white box above 'Recent Posts'.
    *   The borders are visually distinct from the background and clearly delineate the sections, fulfilling the "clearly separate them" objective. They appear to be "thin" and "light gray" as specified.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction uses "such as 'Recent Posts' and 'Recent Comments'", implying these are examples of "distinct sections." The empty white box above 'Recent Posts' functions as a distinct UI element (potentially a search bar or similar input field) within the sidebar area, and its inclusion in the border treatment is consistent with the instruction to border "each distinct section." All identified distinct sections in the sidebar area have received the specified border.
