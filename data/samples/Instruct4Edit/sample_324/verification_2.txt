As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the two images provided.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that when a user's mouse hovers over an item in the main navigation menu, the text of that item should become "slightly bolder" and change its color to a "clear, bright blue." This describes a dynamic visual change that occurs upon user interaction (hover).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Main Navigation Menu:** The main navigation menu is clearly identifiable at the top of the page (e.g., "Home", "About", "Members", etc.).
    *   **Before Image:** In the "before" image, all navigation menu items are displayed in their default state, which appears to be black text with a standard weight. No hover state is active or depicted.
    *   **After Image:** In the "after" image, all navigation menu items are *identical* to their appearance in the "before" image. They are still black text with the same weight. No item shows any change in color (to blue) or boldness, which would indicate a hover state being applied or demonstrated.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements. The instruction describes a *dynamic* visual change that occurs *on hover*. The provided images are *static screenshots*. Neither the "before" nor the "after" image depicts any item in a "hover" state. Crucially, the "after" image shows *no visual difference whatsoever* in the main navigation menu compared to the "before" image. Without a visual representation of the hover state, it is impossible to verify if the text becomes bolder or changes to a clear, bright blue. Based purely on the visual evidence provided, the instructed change is not demonstrated or visible.

**Final verdict:**
