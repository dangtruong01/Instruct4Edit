**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two specific visual changes to the main article heading 'Dr. David Grewell on News about Bioplastics':
    *   Make it "significantly larger" to increase its prominence and grab attention.
    *   "Center it visually on the page."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Size:** In the "before" image, the heading is a standard size, fitting on a single line. In the "after" image, the heading is visibly much larger, now spanning two lines due to the increased font size. This clearly fulfills the "significantly larger" requirement.
    *   **Centering:** In the "before" image, the heading is left-aligned with the rest of the text content. In the "after" image, the heading (both lines of it) is horizontally centered on the page. This clearly fulfills the "center it visually" requirement.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both aspects of the instruction—making the heading significantly larger and centering it—are clearly and fully implemented in the "after" image. The changes are distinct and unambiguous.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
