Here's my review based on your instructions:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to add a "subtle, consistent box shadow effect" to each of the university and organization logos located within the large green footer area.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the logos (Iowa State University, University of Georgia, Washington State University, NDSU, and NSF) appear flat against the green background. In the "after" image, each of these logos has a delicate, dark shadow extending slightly below and to the right, giving them a subtle lifted or "floating" appearance. The effect is uniform and consistent across all five logos.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
None. The shadows are indeed subtle, as requested, and are applied consistently to all the specified logos within the designated footer area. The visual change precisely matches the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
