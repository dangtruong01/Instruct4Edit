Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the "RecallsMe" text in the header larger and bolder. This means increasing the font size and making the font weight heavier.
2. Comparing the two images, the "RecallsMe" text in the header appears to be the same size and weight in both. There is no apparent change.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
