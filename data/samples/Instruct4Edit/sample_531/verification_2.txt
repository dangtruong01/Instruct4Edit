Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main title "Burger Delivery in Churwell" in the header area.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any noticeable shadow added to the specified text in the header area. The text appears visually identical in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
