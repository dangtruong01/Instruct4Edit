Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add rounded corners to each deal card in the special offers section.
2. Looking at the images, I can see that the "deal cards" are the gray boxes containing "50% OFF" and "View deal" button. I cannot see any rounded corners in either the before or after image.
3. There are no visible differences in the corner shapes of the "deal cards" between the two images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
