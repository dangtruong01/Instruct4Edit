Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the font size of the main article title, 'Pop-up ad', with the goal of making it stand out more.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the font size of the 'Pop-up ad' title in the "after" image is distinctly larger than in the "before" image. This increase in size makes the title more prominent and indeed helps it stand out more.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is precisely applied to the specified element, and the effect is clear and unambiguous. No other elements appear to have been unintentionally altered, and the intended outcome (making it stand out more) is achieved visually.

**Final verdict:**
- âœ… Fully Applied
