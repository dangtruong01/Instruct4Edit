**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies that when a user hovers over the navigation menu items (e.g., "Questions", "Définition", "Réseau") located on the left sidebar, their text color should become slightly darker.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon comparing the two images, the text color of all navigation menu items appears identical in both the "before" and "after" versions. There is no discernible difference in the darkness of the text for any of the menu items in the "after" image that would indicate a "hover" state or the application of the instructed change. Since these are static images, we would expect at least one of the menu items to be depicted in its "hovered" (darker) state in the "after" image to demonstrate the successful implementation.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The primary ambiguity is the challenge of representing a "hover" state with static images. However, to fulfill the instruction visually in static images, at least one menu item in the "after" image should have been rendered with the "slightly darker" text color to signify that it is in the intended hovered state. As no such visual change is present for any of the menu items, the instruction does not appear to have been implemented or captured.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
