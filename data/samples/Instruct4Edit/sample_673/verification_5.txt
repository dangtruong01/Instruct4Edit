Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies moving the "copyright notice text" (identified as "2023") from its current position (left-aligned at the bottom) to be horizontally centered at the very bottom of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, the "2023" text is positioned at the extreme bottom-left of the visible content area.
    *   In the "after" image, the "2023" text has been horizontally shifted to appear in the center of the visible page width at the bottom. The horizontal shift is clear and precise.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The text "2023" is clearly the copyright notice, and its alignment has visibly changed from left to center. Its vertical position remains "at the very bottom," as implied by the instruction not specifying a vertical change other than staying at the bottom.
