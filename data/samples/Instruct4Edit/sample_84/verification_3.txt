**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between each distinct message within the 'VZKAZY Z FÓRA' section. This would make individual messages visually separate, thus improving their distinguishability and readability by adding more "breathing room" vertically.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, there is a noticeable and consistent increase in the vertical whitespace between each message block in the left-hand column labeled 'VZKAZY Z FÓRA'. For example, the gap between the message "Záleží na úhlu pohledu hodnotících." and the subsequent message "Ode dneška je třetí řada na Disney+" is significantly larger in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. This increased spacing is maintained throughout the entire column of messages.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was precise ("add more vertical breathing room between each individual message") and the visual implementation in the "after" image perfectly matches this intent. Each message now has ample vertical space separating it from the next, making them much easier to distinguish and read as individual entities.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
