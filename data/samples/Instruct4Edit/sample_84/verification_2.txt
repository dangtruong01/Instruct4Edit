As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images against the provided instruction.

---
**Instruction:** Give all interactive buttons, like 'Celý seriál do cloudu' and the login/search buttons, a more modern and prominent look with a distinct background color and gently rounded corners.

---
**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the visual appearance of all interactive buttons on the page. This includes specific examples like the 'Celý seriál do cloudu' button, and general categories such as 'login' and 'search' buttons. The desired new style includes:
    *   A "more modern and prominent look."
    *   A "distinct background color."
    *   "Gently rounded corners."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **'Celý seriál do cloudu' button:**
        *   **Before:** This button has a default, less prominent appearance with sharp corners and a light background.
        *   **After:** It now features a distinct blue background, white text, and clearly rounded corners, making it significantly more prominent and modern.
    *   **Login/Registration button ('Registrace'):**
        *   **Before:** This button also has a default, unstyled appearance.
        *   **After:** It has been updated with the same distinct blue background, white text, and rounded corners, aligning with the instruction.
    *   **Search buttons:**
        *   **Before:** There were input fields for search but no explicit, prominent "Search" buttons next to them. The search functionality was likely implicit (e.g., pressing Enter).
        *   **After:** Explicit "Hledat" (Search) buttons have been introduced next to the search input fields (one for the main search and two below "Filmy jednotlivé titulky"). These newly added buttons all adhere to the specified style: distinct blue background, white text, and gently rounded corners. While these buttons were *added* where none were explicit before, their inclusion and styling directly address the "prominent look" aspect for "search buttons" as intended by the instruction. By making them visible and styled as buttons, they now fulfill the requirement of being "interactive buttons" with the desired look.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Clarity of "all interactive buttons":** The instruction specified "all interactive buttons" and provided examples. The changes applied cover the explicitly mentioned buttons and the implied interactive elements that function as buttons (like submitting a search). Other interactive elements on the page, such as hyperlinks (e.g., the series links, top navigation, 'VZKAZY Z FÓRA'), were correctly not styled as buttons, as the instruction specifically referred to "buttons."
    *   **Creation vs. Styling:** The most minor ambiguity is that the search buttons were *created* (made explicit) rather than just *restyled* from an existing explicit button. However, in the context of improving UI/UX for "search buttons," making them visually explicit and then styling them to be prominent is a full and clear implementation of the spirit of the instruction. The result is that "search buttons" now exist and meet all the visual requirements.
    *   **"More modern and prominent look":** The blue background, white text, and rounded corners indeed provide a significantly more modern and prominent appearance compared to the original default or absent button styles.

Overall, the changes clearly and fully implement the instruction's requirements for background color, rounded corners, and overall prominence for all identified interactive buttons.
