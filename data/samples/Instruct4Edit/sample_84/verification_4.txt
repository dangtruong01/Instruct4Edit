Here's the comparison and justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intended to improve the visual separation of each episode entry under 'Get out alive with Bear Grylls'. This was to be achieved by adding a "subtle outline or distinct background" to each item, aiming for a more organized list.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, each episode entry (e.g., "1. [001E01]", its corresponding image, and associated text) is now enclosed within a light grey rectangular background block. This background is absent in the "before" image. This added background effectively provides a distinct visual container for each item.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The implementation precisely matches the instruction. A "distinct background" has been added to each episode entry, it is subtle enough, and it clearly enhances the visual separation and organization of the list items as requested.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
