Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
   - The instruction has two main parts for a specific element: the "primary navigation bar, which has the blue background and links like 'Fórum' and 'Seriály'".
   - **Part 1:** This navigation bar should stretch across the full width of the page's main content area.
   - **Part 2:** A logo within this specific navigation bar should be significantly larger and clearly positioned.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
   - **Before image:** At the very top left, there is a narrow blue bar containing links like 'Fórum', 'Seriály', 'Požadavky', etc. This is clearly the element described in the instruction. It is indeed narrow and does not stretch the full width. There doesn't appear to be a distinct logo element within it, or if there is, it's very small and unnoticeable.
   - **After image:** The entire blue navigation bar, along with all the links ('Fórum', 'Seriály', etc.) and any potential logo within it, is **completely absent**. It has been removed from the page.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
   - Yes, there are significant missing elements. The instruction was to *modify* an existing element (stretch it, change its logo). Instead, the element itself has been entirely *removed*.
   - Therefore, neither the stretching of the navigation bar nor the resizing/repositioning of a logo within it could have been implemented, as the element itself is no longer present on the page.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
