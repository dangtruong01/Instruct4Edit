**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that when hovering over the links in the footer, they should *briefly change color or show an underline*. This describes a dynamic interactive effect that occurs upon user interaction (mouse hover).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. A hover state is a dynamic visual response to user interaction and cannot be demonstrated by a single static image unless that image specifically captures a link *in* its hovered state (e.g., a separate screenshot of the footer with one link being hovered). The footer links in the "after" image appear identical to those in the "before" image, showing no visual evidence of a hover effect being applied or demonstrated.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental doubt. The instruction describes an interactive behavior (hover effect), which by nature is dynamic. Static images cannot convey dynamic interactions. To verify this instruction visually, one would require either:
    *   A video recording demonstrating the hover effect.
    *   Separate screenshots explicitly showing a link in its default state and then the same link in its hovered state.
    Since only static "before" and "after" images are provided, and they show no visual difference related to the hover state, it is impossible to visually confirm if the instruction has been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (because it cannot be visually verified from the static images provided)
