Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests an increase in the horizontal spacing (the amount of empty space) between the main navigation items located in the header: "Inicio", "Contacto", "Servicios", "Institucional", and "Novedades". This would make them appear more spread out horizontally.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the horizontal spacing between the navigation items in the header appears to be precisely the same. There is no perceptible increase in the gaps between "Inicio", "Contacto", "Servicios", "Institucional", and "Novedades".

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction to increase horizontal spacing has demonstrably not been implemented. The navigation items and their relative positions are identical in both images.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
