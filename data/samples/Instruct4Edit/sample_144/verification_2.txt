**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the text in the main article content area (the paragraph below the large image) visually:
    *   A bit larger in size.
    *   Slightly lighter in color.
    These changes are intended to improve readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Text Size:** Upon close inspection, the text in the main article content area ("Ha dejado de existir...") appears to be the exact same size in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no visible increase in font size.
    *   **Text Color:** The color of the text in the main article content area also appears to be identical in both images. It remains a very dark grey or black, with no visible softening or lightening.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts. Neither of the instructed changes (larger size or lighter color) are visibly implemented in the "after" image. The text remains unchanged in both its size and color in the specified area.

**Final verdict:**
