As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, here is my assessment:

**Instruction:** Center the main title of the article on the page.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The intended visual change is to horizontally align the text "RAMÓN OSBALDO OROZCO (q.e.p.d)" to the center of the page or its containing content area, shifting it from its original left-aligned position.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, in the "after" image, the main title "RAMÓN OSBALDO OROZCO (q.e.p.d)" has clearly moved from its left-aligned position in the "before" image and now appears visually centered horizontally on the page.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction specifically targets "the main title." While the date and category line ("Mar 22, 2022 | Necrológicas") directly below the main title remains left-aligned (relative to its original position or the content area's left edge), the instruction did not include this line. Therefore, no elements are missing from the *specified* change. The main title itself is clearly centered.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
