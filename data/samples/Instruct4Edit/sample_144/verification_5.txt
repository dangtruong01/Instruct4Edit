Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to increase the amount of vertical spacing both above and below the large image in the article content.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, there is noticeably more vertical space between the date/category line ("Mar 22, 2022 | Necrológicas") and the top of the large image. Similarly, there is a distinct increase in vertical space between the bottom of the large image and the beginning of the article text ("Ha dejado de existir...").

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The added vertical space is clear and applied both above and below the image as implied by "around".

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
