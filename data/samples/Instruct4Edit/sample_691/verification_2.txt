Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing between each person's entry in the follower list. This means there should be more empty space vertically separating "Dino Brogialdi" from "Bob Wilson", "Bob Wilson" from "Gabbi S", and so on, for all entries.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close inspection and comparison of both images, the vertical spacing between each person listed in the follower list appears to be identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in "breathing room" between any of the entries.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction appears to have not been implemented at all. The two images, specifically the layout of the follower list, seem visually identical.

**Final verdict:**
