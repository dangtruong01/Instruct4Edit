Here's my analysis:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction specifies that the "Sign up" and "Follow" buttons should transition from their current rounded appearance to a less rounded, more block-like form. This means their corners should become sharper, closer to a 90-degree angle, reducing their current border-radius significantly.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, this change is not clearly visible.
*   **"Sign up" button:** In both the "before" and "after" images, the "Sign up" button in the top right corner retains its highly rounded corners. There is no discernible difference in its shape or corner radius.
*   **"Follow" buttons:** Similarly, all the "Follow" buttons on the right side of the follower list maintain their original pill-like or extremely rounded rectangular shape in both the "before" and "after" images. Their corners have not become less rounded or more block-like.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there is significant doubt because the core instruction of making the buttons "less rounded, more block-like" has not been implemented at all. The buttons appear visually identical in terms of their shape and corner rounding between the two images.

**Final verdict:**
