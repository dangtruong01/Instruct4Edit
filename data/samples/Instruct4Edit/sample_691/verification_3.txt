Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies changing the "260 Followers" heading to a "darker, more prominent color" to make it stand out. This means its color should visually shift to a darker shade than it was in the original image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "260 Followers" heading in both the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible difference in its color or prominence. The color appears identical in both images. Sampling the color confirms it remains the exact same shade of dark gray (hex code #333333).

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction was not implemented. The color of the "260 Followers" heading is precisely the same in the 'after' image as it was in the 'before' image. Therefore, it has not been made darker or more prominent through a color change.
