Here's my review based on the instruction and visual comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Increase the size of the social media icons (which are currently represented as text links) in the footer.
    *   Apply the recognizable brand color for each social media platform to its respective icon/text link (e.g., Facebook blue, YouTube red, etc.).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Size:** No. The text links for "Facebook", "Instagram", "LinkedIn", and "Youtube" appear to be the exact same size in the "after" image as they are in the "before" image. No visual icons were added or made larger.
    *   **Color:** No. All social media text links remain black in the "after" image, identical to their appearance in the "before" image. They do not display their respective brand colors.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There are no doubts; neither part of the instruction (making them larger or applying brand colors) has been implemented. The elements in question are visually identical in both images regarding size and color.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
