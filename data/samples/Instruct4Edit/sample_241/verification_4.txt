Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical space between the main article text and the comments section located directly below it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the vertical space between the last line of the main article text ("...Snap Consumer AR Australia Report 2021.") and the "Comments powered by Disqus" heading is relatively small. In the "after" image, this specific vertical space has been significantly increased, creating a more pronounced separation between the two sections.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The increase in vertical space is precisely at the specified location and is clearly evident in the "after" image.
