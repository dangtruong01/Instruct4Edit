Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the 'News' link in the main navigation bar stand out as "more distinctly selected." It offers two specific methods: a bolder color or a subtle background highlight.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the 'News' link in the "after" image now has a subtle, light gray background highlight. This highlight is clearly visible when comparing it to the "before" image, where no such highlight was present. This visual change makes the 'News' link appear distinct from the other navigation items.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction provided two options ("bolder color or a subtle background highlight") to achieve the desired effect. The design chose to implement the "subtle background highlight" option. This chosen method successfully makes the 'News' link "more distinctly selected" as requested. While a bolder color was not applied, it was presented as an alternative, not a mandatory addition alongside a highlight. Therefore, the core instruction of making it more distinct via one of the suggested methods has been fulfilled.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
