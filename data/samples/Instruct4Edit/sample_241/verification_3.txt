Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the 'Join' button in the newsletter signup section more noticeable and appealing. It suggests achieving this by adding a solid background color or rounded corners.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the 'Join' button is a white button with a thin black border and black text.
    *   In the "after" image, the 'Join' button has a prominent solid red background color with white text. The corners also appear to be slightly rounded, contributing to a softer, more inviting look compared to the sharp corners of the bordered button in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The primary suggestions for increased prominence and invitingness – a solid background color and subtle rounding – have both been implemented, significantly altering the button's appearance as intended. The "or" in the instruction ("like a solid background color **or** rounded corners") means fulfilling either would be sufficient, but in this case, both aspects contribute to the desired outcome.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
