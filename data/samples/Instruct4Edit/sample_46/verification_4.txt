Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The sidebar on the right should be narrower. This means the space occupied by the sidebar elements (the "About Me" section, previous posts, etc.) should be reduced in width.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the sidebar has clearly been narrowed. The elements within the sidebar now take up less horizontal space.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is very clear.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
