Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect to the box containing "Scott A. Smith, M.D." in the sidebar. This should visually lift the box from the background, making it stand out.
2. By carefully comparing the two images, I can see a faint shadow effect around the box containing "Scott A. Smith, M.D." in the second image (the "after" image). This is not present in the first image.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements; the shadow effect is subtle but noticeable.

Final verdict:
