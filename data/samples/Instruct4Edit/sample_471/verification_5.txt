Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding around the testimonial comments. This means adding space between the comment text and the surrounding container or borders.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible change in the padding around the testimonial comments. The text appears to be in the same position relative to the surrounding elements in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the lack of visible change suggests that the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
