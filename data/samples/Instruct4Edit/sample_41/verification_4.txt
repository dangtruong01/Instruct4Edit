Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to add padding, creating space around the image within the main content area.
2. There is no visible change in padding around the image in the "after" image. The image appears to be positioned identically in both images.
3. The instruction appears to be skipped.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
