Step-by-step justification:
1.  The instruction is to add space between table rows to visually separate them. This implies increasing the vertical gap between the content sections (e.g., Introduction, Windows, Unix daemon) in the text.
2.  The after image shows increased spacing between the content sections compared to the before image. For example, the space between "Introduction" and "Windows" is visibly greater in the after image. Also, the space between "Windows" and "Unix daemon" is increased in the after image.
3.  There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
