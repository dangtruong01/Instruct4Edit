Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to make the links in the left-hand navigation bolder. This means the font weight of the text should be increased, making the text appear thicker and darker.
2.  **Visibility of Change:** It is difficult to verify this change. Both images appear to be identical and therefore the font weight of the links is not changed in the second image.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The change is not visible.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
