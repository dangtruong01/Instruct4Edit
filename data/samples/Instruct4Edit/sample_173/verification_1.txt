Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the font size of the main heading "Tomcat Setup".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the heading "Tomcat Setup" is visibly larger in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clear and unambiguous.

Final verdict:
