Here's a detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks to increase the vertical spacing within the footer section. Specifically, it highlights the need for more space between the copyright text ("版权所有 中老信息网") and the contact details (lines like "中老信息网 邮箱:", "电话:", "传真:", "联系人:", "网址:"). The overall goal is to improve readability and reduce crowding in this area.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible.
*   In the "before" image, the lines within the contact details block and between the contact details and the copyright are very condensed.
*   In the "after" image, there is a noticeable increase in vertical spacing:
    *   The spacing between individual lines of contact information (e.g., between "电话:" and "传真:", or "联系人:" and "网址:") has been increased, making each line stand out more.
    *   Crucially, the vertical space between the last contact detail ("网址:http://www.zlmh.net") and the copyright text ("版权所有 中老信息网") has been significantly increased. There's a clear, distinct empty line or larger gap added here, which was the primary emphasis of the instruction.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, the instruction was fully and effectively implemented. The increased spacing is evident throughout the specified footer section, especially between the contact details and the copyright, achieving the stated goal of improved readability and a less crowded appearance.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
