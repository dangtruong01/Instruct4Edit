Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to identify section titles in the left column (e.g., "勐腊边境之窗", "联系我们") and apply a *solid background color* to them. The purpose of this change is to make their *white text easily readable*, implying the original background was insufficient for good contrast.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The section titles "勐腊边境之窗", "联系我们", and "老挝便民服务" are displayed with white text directly on a bright green background that forms the general left-column area. There is no distinct background color for the titles themselves. The readability of the white text on this bright green is moderate.
    *   **After Image:** All three identified section titles ("勐腊边境之窗", "联系我们", and "老挝便民服务") now have a distinct, darker, solid background color (appears to be a dark teal or a darker shade of green). This new background is clearly separate from the broader bright green area. The white text on this darker background is significantly more readable and stands out prominently.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is clear and consistent. The specified section titles (and other similar titles in the same visual style and position) have received the solid background color. The improved readability of the white text is evident. The instruction was precise and the implementation matches it.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
