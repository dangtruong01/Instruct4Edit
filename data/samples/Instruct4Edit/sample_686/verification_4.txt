**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to introduce unique and relevant images next to each article preview in the main content area. This implies replacing existing placeholder images with actual, distinct images, or adding images where none currently exist if the "placeholder" was an invisible element or conceptual.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. In the "before" image, the article previews in the main content area (the list items with titles, authors, and dates) do not display any images, placeholder or otherwise. They are purely text-based entries. In the "after" image, this remains exactly the same; no images have been added or changed in relation to the article previews.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, there is a clear ambiguity. The instruction presumes the existence of "current placeholder images" that need to be replaced. However, visually, there are no images at all (placeholder or otherwise) displayed within the article previews in the "before" image. Since no images are visible in the "after" image either, the instruction to ensure images are displayed and unique/relevant has not been met. The core visual change (the appearance of images) is entirely absent.
