Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color and shape of the line under the name. The color should be a lighter shade of gray, and the shape should have rounded edges.
2. I can't see a line under the name in either image.
3. It is difficult to say if the changes have been made, because there is no apparent line.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
