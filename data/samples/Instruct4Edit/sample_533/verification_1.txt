Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the navigation menu (presumably the list of links on the left) to have its background color removed and to feature a subtle hover effect on the links.
2. The background color of the navigation menu in the AFTER image has indeed been removed, matching the requested change. It is now transparent. However, there is no visible hover effect on the links in the after image.
3. The instruction did not specify what the hover effect should look like, only that it should be subtle. The absence of any hover effect means the instruction was not fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
