Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the footer navigation menu to have a background color that distinguishes it from the surrounding footer content.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no change in the background color of the footer navigation menu or any other visual differentiation. The footer remains the same in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
