Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing around the central title "Prapanpong Pongsriiam". This implies adding more whitespace above and below the title, and potentially to the left and right as well.
2. Upon comparing the two images, the spacing above and below the title "Prapanpong Pongsriiam" appears to be visually similar. There is no clear increase in the whitespace.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the visual change is not apparent.

Final verdict:
