Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction requests a darker shade of the existing color for the navigation bar's background.
2.  **Visibility of change:** The background color appears to be the same in both images.
3.  **Doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements:** The change is not visible.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
