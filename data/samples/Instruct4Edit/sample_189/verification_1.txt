Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the size of the logo in the header.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**  There is no logo visible in either image. Therefore, it is impossible to increase the size of something that doesn't exist.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The element in question, the logo, is missing from both images.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
