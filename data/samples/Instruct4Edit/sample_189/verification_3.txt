Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical space between the heading "What Is Tax Deferral?" and the first paragraph that follows.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the spacing between the heading and the paragraph has been increased.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
