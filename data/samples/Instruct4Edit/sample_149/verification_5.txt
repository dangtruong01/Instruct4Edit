**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to replace all heavy, prominent horizontal lines that visually segmented content sections with more subtle visual dividers. These replacements were to take the form of either increased vertical spacing between content blocks or very faint, thin lines, with the ultimate goal of achieving a cleaner and less cluttered layout.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly and consistently visible throughout the modified image.
    *   In the "before" image, there were multiple thick, black horizontal lines separating distinct content blocks (e.g., below "Please wait 2 seconds...", below the introductory paragraph for "How to Unlock", below the "YOUR REFERENCE OR SOURCE LINK?" section, below "FEW REASONS WHY YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR SOURCE LINK IMMEDIATELY:", and below the "Attention:" section).
    *   In the "after" image, all these heavy lines have been successfully removed.
    *   In place of these lines, there is now significantly increased vertical spacing, effectively providing separation without visual clutter.
    *   Additionally, a very faint, thin gray line has been introduced above the "How to Unlock" section, fulfilling the "very faint, thin lines" option mentioned in the instruction for subtle division.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction provided two acceptable methods for replacing the lines, and the designer has effectively utilized both (primarily increased spacing, with one instance of a faint line) to achieve the specified outcome. All instances of heavy horizontal lines from the "before" image have been addressed as per the instruction. The layout appears noticeably cleaner and less cluttered, fulfilling the overarching goal.

**Final verdict:**
