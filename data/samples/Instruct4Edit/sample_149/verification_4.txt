Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to remove a visible "solid border or frame" around the main content section. This removal should result in the content appearing to flow more openly, creating a less "boxy" feel for the central content block.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of both images, I cannot discern any visual difference between the "before" and "after" states.
In the "before" image, the main content block (from "Please wait 2 seconds..." down to "gated page.") appears to have a very subtle, light gray shadow or faint outline, which subtly defines its boundaries and gives it a contained, slightly "boxy" appearance.
In the "after" image, this exact same subtle shadow/outline is still present. No border or frame, whether solid or subtle, has been removed. The content's visual presentation, including its "boxy" feel due to the defined content area and its subtle surrounding shadow, remains unchanged.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
My primary doubt is the complete lack of any visual change whatsoever between the two images concerning the instruction. If there was a border or frame to be removed, it is still visibly present (or rather, the subtle defining shadow is still present). If the instruction implicitly meant to remove the subtle shadow/outline that gives the content its contained feel, then it was not implemented. If it strictly meant a "solid border," and there was none to begin with, then no change was expected, but the prompt implies a change was *instructed* and should be *applied*. Since the images are identical, the intended visual change was not applied.

**Final verdict:**
