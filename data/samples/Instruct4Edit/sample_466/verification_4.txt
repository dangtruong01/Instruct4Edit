Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the main heading font to a bolder typeface. This implies increasing the font-weight of the main headings across the page.
2. Looking at the two images, it is difficult to determine which element is considered the "main heading" as there are multiple texts that could be considered a "main heading".
3. Without knowing exactly which element the instruction is referring to, it's impossible to determine whether the change has been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
