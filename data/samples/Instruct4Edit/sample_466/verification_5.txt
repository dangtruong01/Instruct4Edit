Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the footer widgets' heading text (Producten, Hulp, Contact, Over) a brighter shade of gray.
2. Comparing the two images, the heading text in the footer appears to be slightly lighter in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
3. However, the difference is very subtle. It's difficult to say with absolute certainty if the change has been applied or it's simply due to a slight variation in image rendering.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
