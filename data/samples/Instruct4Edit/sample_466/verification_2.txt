Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the header. This would mean a dark or light area that gives the illusion of the header being slightly raised from the rest of the page.
2. Visually comparing the two images, I cannot perceive any difference in the header area. There is no visible shadow.
3. The image quality is sufficient. No elements are missing. However, the change is absent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
