Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation menu items. The navigation menu items are "Producten, Kennisbank, Over ons, Contact".
2. I need to check the spacing between these items in both images and see if it has increased in the second image. Upon inspecting, the spacing appears to be the same.
3. There is no visible change in spacing.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
