**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  The instruction specifies moving the floating "Сессия под ключ!" button further from the right edge of the screen. This implies increasing the horizontal distance between the button and the screen's right boundary.
2.  Visually comparing the two images, the "Сессия под ключ!" button in the "after" image is indeed positioned slightly further away from the right edge of the screen than in the "before" image. The horizontal distance has increased.
3.  There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The instruction is simple and the change is visually evident.

**Final verdict:**

✅ Fully Applied
