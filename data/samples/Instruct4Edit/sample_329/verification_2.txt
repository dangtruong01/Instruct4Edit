**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific visual changes to all text input fields within the form:
    *   Add a "subtle border" around them.
    *   Give them a "slightly rounded appearance".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The text input fields (e.g., "Navn(Påkrevd)", "Fullt navn", "Telefon", etc., and the three smaller input fields) are primarily flat white rectangles with no discernible border or rounded corners. The larger text area below "informasjonskapsler" has a default browser-rendered border, but no explicit rounding.
    *   **After Image:**
        *   **Borders:** All the identified text input fields and the larger text area now clearly display a very thin, light grey border around them. This border is indeed subtle and consistent across all fields.
        *   **Rounded Appearance:** The sharp 90-degree corners of all these fields in the "before" image have been replaced with noticeably, yet subtly, rounded corners in the "after" image. This applies to all input fields and the text area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The changes are clearly visible, consistent across all relevant elements, and accurately reflect both aspects of the instruction ("subtle border" and "slightly rounded appearance"). All text input fields (including the textarea) appear to have been updated.

**Final verdict:**
