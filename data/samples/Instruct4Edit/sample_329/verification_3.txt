**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The instruction has two parts:
        *   Widen the entire "Ja takk, jeg ønsker mer informasjon" section horizontally so it takes up more space.
        *   Change the background color of this section to a lighter color.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Background Color Change:** Yes, the background color of the "Ja takk, jeg ønsker mer informasjon" section (which appears as a light green/khaki box) has clearly changed from a medium green shade in the "before" image to a noticeably lighter, mint-like green in the "after" image. This part of the instruction is fully and clearly visible.
    *   **Widen Section:** No, the section has not widened. Upon close comparison, the horizontal dimensions of the "Ja takk, jeg ønsker mer informasjon" section (both the containing background box and the internal form elements like input fields and text) appear to be exactly the same in both the "before" and "after" images. Neither the left nor the right edge of the section has shifted to increase its horizontal footprint.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   Yes, there is a significant missing element: the instruction to "widen the entire 'Ja takk, jeg ønsker mer informasjon' section on the page so it takes up more horizontal space" was not implemented. The section maintains its original width.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
