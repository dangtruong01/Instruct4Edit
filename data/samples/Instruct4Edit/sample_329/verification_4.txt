Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the size of the company logo. The expected location of this logo is the "top left corner of the website".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of both the "before" and "after" images, there is no company logo visible in the top left corner (or anywhere else for that matter) in either image. Both images display a solid dark green bar in the top header section, with no discernible logo element. Therefore, no change in the size of a non-existent logo can be observed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental missing element: the company logo itself. The instruction presumes the existence of a logo in the specified location. Since no logo is visually present in either the original or the modified image, it is impossible to verify whether its size has been increased. The instruction could not be applied because the target element is absent.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (or more accurately, **Cannot Be Verified** due to the absence of the target element in the visuals provided.)
