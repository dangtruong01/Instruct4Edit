Here's the detailed analysis:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to make the "submit button" on the information request form more prominent. This prominence should be achieved through two specific visual modifications:
    *   A brighter background color.
    *   Rounded edges.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**

*   **Identifying the "submit button":** In both images, the four small, interactive-looking boxes below "Jeg godtar vilkårene (Påkrevd)" appear to be the submit buttons or action triggers for the form.
*   **Background Color:**
    *   **Before:** The buttons have a white background.
    *   **After:** The buttons have a distinct green background. While white is technically the brightest color in terms of luminosity, the green chosen in the "after" image is a vibrant color that contrasts more with the surrounding white input fields and the overall form background, making the buttons *stand out* and appear *more prominent* than the plain white did. In the context of UI design, "brighter" often implies more vibrant or eye-catching, which this green certainly is compared to the previous state.
*   **Rounded Edges:**
    *   **Before:** The buttons have sharp, 90-degree corners.
    *   **After:** The corners of the green buttons are visibly softer and subtly rounded. The change is not dramatic (e.g., pill-shaped), but the edges are no longer sharp.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
*   **"Brighter background color":** As noted, the term "brighter" can be interpreted in luminosity, where white is brightest. However, in design, it often implies increased visual prominence or vibrancy. The chosen green achieves this prominence effectively by introducing a distinct color where there was none before, making it more eye-catching. This is not an ambiguity that prevents the instruction from being considered applied.
*   **"Rounded edges":** The edges are indeed rounded, though subtly. The instruction did not specify the degree of rounding, so the subtle change is sufficient to meet the requirement.
*   The instruction mentions "the submit button" (singular), but there are four identical elements. All four have been consistently modified, which is good.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
