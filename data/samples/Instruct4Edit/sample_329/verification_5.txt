Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to center all text content found within each column of the website footer. This would mean changing the horizontal alignment of the text from its original alignment (likely left-aligned) to a centered alignment within the bounds of each footer column.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible in either image. The provided images display a form and cookie consent information, but there is no visible website footer section containing columns of text content in either the "before" or "after" state.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is significant ambiguity because the element targeted by the instruction – "the website footer" with its "columns of text content" – is completely absent from both the "before" and "after" images. Without the presence of the footer, it's impossible to verify whether any text centering was applied to it.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
