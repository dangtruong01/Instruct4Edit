1. The instruction aims to increase the spacing between different sections of content to improve readability. Visually, this would mean more white space or distance between elements like headings, paragraphs, and images.
2. Comparing the two images, the "after" image doesn't show any significant increase in spacing between the sections of content. While there might be minor changes, they are not easily noticeable.
3. The lack of a clear visual change regarding spacing raises doubts about the implementation.
