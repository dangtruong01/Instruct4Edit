Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction aims to make the navigation links more prominent. This is to be achieved by two specific changes: increasing the font size of the links and changing their color to white.
2.  **Is the change clearly visible?** The image comparison does *not* show that the navigation links have been changed to white. The image also does not show an obvious increase in font size.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, both font size and color changes are missing.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
