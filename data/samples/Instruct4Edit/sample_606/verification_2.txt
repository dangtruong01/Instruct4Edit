Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the social media icons in the sidebar to match the gold color used for links in the footer. I cannot see social media icons in the sidebar in either image. However, there are social media icons in the upper right corner of the video player in both images.
2. Since I do not know if the video player icons are considered to be "social media icons in the sidebar", I will assume that they are not.
3. There are no social media icons visible in the sidebar, making the instruction impossible to implement based on the provided images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
