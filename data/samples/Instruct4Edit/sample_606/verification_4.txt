Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle gray border to the video iframe. This means a thin, gray-colored outline should be visible around the video player.
2. Visually comparing the two images, I cannot detect any difference in the appearance of the video iframe. Specifically, there is no gray border visible around the video in the "after" image that wasn't present in the "before" image.
3. The lack of a visible gray border constitutes a missing element.

Final verdict:
