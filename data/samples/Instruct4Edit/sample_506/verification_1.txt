Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing around the image on the page. This means adding more visual space between the image and the surrounding elements (text, other images, page edges).
2. Comparing the two images, the space around the main image (the church) appears to be negligibly different.
3. It's difficult to determine if there's any change at all in the spacing.

Final verdict:
