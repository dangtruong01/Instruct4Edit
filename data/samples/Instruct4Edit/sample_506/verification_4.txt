Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to evenly distribute and align the sections in the footer. This means the "Fijn om te weten" and "Contact informatie" sections should be more evenly spaced and aligned horizontally.
2. In the 'after' image, the "Fijn om te weten" and "Contact informatie" sections are now side-by-side, which suggests a more even distribution compared to the 'before' image, where "Contact informatie" was below "Fijn om te weten".
3. The sections appear to be horizontally aligned.

Final verdict:
