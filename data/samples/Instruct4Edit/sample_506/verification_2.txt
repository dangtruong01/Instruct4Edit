Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to center the image and title on the page. This means the horizontal center of both the image and the title should coincide with the horizontal center of the page.
2. Visually comparing the before and after images, it appears that the image and title have not been centered. They still appear to be aligned to the left.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities, but the change is not visible in the after image.

Final verdict:
