**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the "Yes" and "No" text links in the "Was this article helpful?" section into:
    *   More prominent and clearly clickable visual elements.
    *   Elements with a distinct button style (e.g., background, border, text color).
    *   Elements that exhibit a subtle hover effect upon interaction.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Prominent, clickable elements:** Yes. In the "before" image, "Yes" and "No" appear as standard blue, underlined text links. In the "after" image, they are clearly styled as distinct buttons with a solid blue background, white text, and slightly rounded corners. This transformation significantly increases their prominence and visual indication of clickability.
    *   **Clear button style:** Yes. The addition of a solid background color, contrasting text color, and rounded borders creates a clear and recognizable button style, differentiating them from plain text or links.
    *   **Subtle hover effect:** No, this change is *not* visible. As a static image reviewer, it is impossible to observe or verify the presence or subtlety of a dynamic hover effect. This interactive element cannot be confirmed from the provided visual information.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes. While the visual transformation into prominent, styled buttons is clearly evident and successfully applied, the instruction also specifically requires a "subtle hover effect." This interactive component cannot be verified from the static "before" and "after" images. Therefore, a critical part of the instruction remains unconfirmed visually.
