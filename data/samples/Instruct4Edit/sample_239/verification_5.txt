Here's the review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing (line-height) between lines of text within all multi-line paragraphs in the main article body. The goal is to improve readability. This means headings, short single-line elements (like list items that don't wrap), and form elements should generally not be affected unless they are part of a wrapping paragraph structure.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible.
*   The introductory paragraph ("Fix POP or IMAP client sending and receiving issues. Third-party email clients...") shows a noticeable increase in line spacing in the "after" image.
*   All subsequent paragraphs within the main content sections (e.g., "Confirm app is configured...", "This is required if you've enabled Yahoo account key...", "Check for extra email address...", "Check your connected devices...", "Update your app...", "Check for software blocking ports...", "Contact your app manufacturer or use a different app...") consistently exhibit increased vertical space between their lines of text.
*   Even long sentences within list-like structures that wrap to multiple lines (e.g., the long sentence under "Confirm app is configured with the correct POP settings or IMAP settings for Yahoo Mail...") have their line spacing increased, which aligns with the spirit of making "text within... content" easier to read.
*   Elements that are not multi-line paragraphs (like main headings, single-line list items, the survey questions, and footer navigation) have correctly not had their line spacing altered, as they do not contain lines of text *within* a paragraph to space out.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is consistently applied to all identifiable paragraphs and wrapping text blocks within the main article content. The visual increase in spacing is clear and appears to enhance readability as intended.

**Final verdict:**
