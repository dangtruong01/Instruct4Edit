Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to visually increase the vertical distance between individual lines of text within the main content paragraphs, and potentially between paragraphs, to improve readability and reduce perceived text density.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the lines of text within the main content paragraphs (the large text block on the right) are noticeably further apart compared to the "before" image. This increased line-height makes the text appear less dense and gives it more "breathing room."

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities. The change directly addresses the instruction to "increase the vertical spacing between lines of text." The effect is clear and consistent across the main content area.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
