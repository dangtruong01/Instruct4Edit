Here's my cautious review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make all prominent section headers, particularly those in the left sidebar, appear visually softer. This softness is specifically defined by applying rounded edges to all corners of these headers and increasing their internal padding to an adequate level. The style should be consistent across all affected headers.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **"Prominent section headers, especially those in the left sidebar"**: In the "before" image, the headers "Il meglio del Web" and "Web Links" in the left sidebar are clearly prominent section headers, presented as blue background rectangles with sharp 90-degree corners.
    *   **"Rounded edges on all corners"**: In the "after" image, both "Il meglio del Web" and "Web Links" now visibly have rounded corners. The radius appears consistent between the two headers.
    *   **"Adequate internal padding"**: Comparing the "after" image to the "before", there is a noticeable increase in the internal space around the text within both "Il meglio del Web" and "Web Links" headers. This increased padding contributes to a softer, less cramped appearance.
    *   **"Consistent, softer visual style"**: The change is applied consistently to both headers in the left sidebar, and the combination of rounded corners and increased padding does create a "softer" visual impression compared to the sharp, tight original.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction mentions "all prominent section headers". Besides the two in the left sidebar, the main title "Le Lenti a Contatto" is a prominent header. However, it is pure text and not a container with "corners" to round. Therefore, it does not fall under the specific visual requirement of "rounded edges on all corners" that implies a background element.
    *   The sub-sections under "Web Links" (e.g., "Novità sulle Lenti a Contatto", "Occhialeria") are not "section headers" in the same visual style as the main "Web Links" box; they are more akin to list items or sub-links and do not have backgrounds with corners to round.
    *   Given the visual structure of the page, the only elements that fit the description of "prominent section headers" *that are contained elements with corners* are indeed the two headers in the left sidebar. Both have been modified as per the instruction. The definition of "adequate padding" is subjective, but the increase is clearly visible and improves the appearance.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
