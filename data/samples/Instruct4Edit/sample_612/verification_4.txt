Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the button at the bottom of the FAQ section a brighter, more inviting color to encourage clicks. This implies changing the button's color to something more visually appealing and attention-grabbing.
2. The "after" image shows a button with inline styling `style="background-color: #FFD700; color: #000;"`. The background color is a bright yellow, and the text color is black. The "before" image shows a button with styling `class="button btn-block"`. The color of the button is a greyish color.
3. There are no doubts or ambiguities. The button color has indeed been changed to a brighter color.
