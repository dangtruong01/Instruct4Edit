Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a light gray background color to the toggles containing questions and answers to separate them from the white background.
2. By comparing the two images, it's clear that the area around the toggles has been given a light gray background color in the "after" image, making them visually distinct from the surrounding white background.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements; the instruction has been implemented as described.

Final verdict:
