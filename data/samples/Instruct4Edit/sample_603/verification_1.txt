Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the main title font bigger and bolder. The "main title" refers to the largest heading on the page: "Unveiling Busan's Digital Gem: 펀초이스".
2. Comparing the two images, the font size of the main title appears larger in the after image. The font also appears bolder in the after image.
3. There are no ambiguities. The change is visible and consistent with the instructions.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
