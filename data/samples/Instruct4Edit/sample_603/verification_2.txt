Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the main content area. This should create a visual separation between the main content and the sidebar.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible border around the main content area in the "after" image. The sidebar and the content area look identical in terms of having any type of visual separation.
3. There are no doubts. The border is simply missing.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
