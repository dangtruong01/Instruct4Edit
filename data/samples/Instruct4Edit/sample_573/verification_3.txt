Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the menu items in the main navigation. The main navigation is "HOME", "HEALTH & FITNESS", "PERSONAL CARE", and "QUOTES" located at the top of the image.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the spacing between these menu items appears to be unchanged.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the requested change is not visible.

Final verdict:
