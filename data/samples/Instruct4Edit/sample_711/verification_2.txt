Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies that the search bar in the navigation should have rounded corners.
2. There is no navigation bar or search bar present in either image. Therefore, the instruction cannot be applied.
3. The key element - the search bar within the navigation - is missing from both images, making it impossible to evaluate the implementation of rounded corners.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
