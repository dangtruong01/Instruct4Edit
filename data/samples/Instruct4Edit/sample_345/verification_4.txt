Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect to the navigation menu. The navigation menu appears to be the top section of the page where links such as "Flights", "VAirlines", "RTerminal" etc are located.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernible shadow effect added to the navigation menu in the second image. The menu appears identical to the first image.
3. It seems the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
