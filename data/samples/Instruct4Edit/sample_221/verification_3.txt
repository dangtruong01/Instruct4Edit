Here's my assessment:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase the vertical separation between individual paragraphs within the article's main text block. This is intended to visually break up the text, making it less dense and easier to read.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is a consistent, albeit subtle, increase in the vertical spacing between the text blocks that constitute paragraphs in the main article body. This includes the space after the bulleted list and between subsequent paragraphs of regular text. The overall content block of the article appears slightly taller in the "after" image due to this added spacing.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no significant doubts or missing elements. The instruction was simply to "add more vertical spacing," which has been done. The amount added is not specified, so any increase fulfills the instruction. The change appears consistently applied to the paragraphs within the article text.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
