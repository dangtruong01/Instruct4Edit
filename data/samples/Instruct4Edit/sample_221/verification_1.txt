As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have compared the two images provided.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to increase the prominence of the main website title ("Компьютерная помощь") by making it appear bolder and slightly larger in size.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "after" image, the main title "Компьютерная помощь" is distinctly bolder and appears to be slightly larger in font size compared to its rendition in the "before" image. This combination effectively enhances its prominence.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction was precise and the visual changes applied clearly and unambiguously address both parts of the instruction (bolder appearance and slightly larger size) for the correct element (the main title).

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
