Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requested an increase in the space between the main navigation items located within the dark grey menu bar at the top of the page. These items are "Частые вопросы", "Вопросы про MAC OS", "Вопросы про Windows", etc. Given their vertical stacking, the instruction implies increasing the vertical spacing between these list items.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, the vertical spacing between the navigation items in the dark grey menu bar appears to be precisely the same in both images. There is no discernible increase in space.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The requested visual change (increased spacing) has not been implemented. The navigation items retain their original spacing.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
