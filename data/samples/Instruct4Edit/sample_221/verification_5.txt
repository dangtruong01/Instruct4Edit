Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to visually modify the "Read also" recommendation box by changing its sharp, 90-degree corners into softer, rounded corners.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the blue box containing "Читайте также: Инсайдер Equal Leaks показал серию изображений Asus ZenFone 9." has distinctly sharp, square corners. In the "after" image, the same blue box shows a clear rounding on all four corners. The visual difference is unmistakable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction specifically referred to "the 'Read also' recommendation box," which is clearly identifiable as the blue box. The change has been applied precisely to this element, and no other elements appear to have been affected, nor is there any ambiguity regarding the corners being rounded.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
