Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the header. This aims to visually separate the header from the main content, making it more prominent.
2. Comparing the two images, I can't see any noticeable shadow added to the header in the "after" image. The header looks identical to the "before" image.
3. There is no shadow visible on the header in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
