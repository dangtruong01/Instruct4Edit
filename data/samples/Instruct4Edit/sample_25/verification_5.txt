Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to change the footer's background color to a slightly darker shade of its current color.
2.  **Visibility of Change:** The "after" image seems to have a footer of a slightly darker color than the "before" image's footer.
3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The change is subtle, but the difference is noticeable.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
