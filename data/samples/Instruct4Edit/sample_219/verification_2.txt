**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies three main changes for the forum's primary logo image:
    *   Increase its size.
    *   Center it horizontally at the very top of the page.
    *   Ensure it becomes more prominent and noticeable (stands out).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Primary Logo Identification:** In the "before" image, the "The Military Heraldry Society" green/red logo in the top-left corner appears to be the primary logo.
    *   **Size Increase:** Comparing the "before" and "after" images, this specific logo is visibly and significantly larger in the "after" image.
    *   **Centering at the Top:** In the "before" image, the logo is in the top-left. In the "after" image, it has been moved and is now clearly centered horizontally at the very top of the main content area of the page.
    *   **Standing Out:** Due to its increased size and prominent central placement, the logo in the "after" image draws significantly more attention and stands out much more than its smaller, corner-placed counterpart in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no apparent doubts or ambiguities. The identified primary logo has been clearly scaled up, repositioned to the center top, and its increased prominence is undeniable. All aspects of the instruction appear to have been fully addressed.

**Final verdict:**
