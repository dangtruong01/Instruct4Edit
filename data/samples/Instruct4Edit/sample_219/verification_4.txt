Here's a step-by-step justification of the visual comparison:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction specifies applying "a subtle rounded edge to all main content boxes" to "soften their appearance." It provides examples: "the 'vBulletin Message' panel and the login form within it." This means the borders of these rectangular elements should transition from sharp, 90-degree corners to slightly curved, rounded corners.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Target 1: The 'vBulletin Message' panel (the large dark green box).**
    *   In the "before" image, the corners of this large green panel (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right) are clearly sharp and perfectly square.
    *   In the "after" image, upon close inspection, these same corners remain perfectly sharp and square. There is no visible rounding whatsoever, even subtle. The pixels at the corners form a precise 90-degree angle, identical to the "before" image.
*   **Target 2: The login form within it.**
    *   The "login form within it" refers to the area inside the 'vBulletin Message' panel where the login fields ('User Name:', 'Password:') are located. This area is contained by the large green box itself. Since the main green box shows no rounding, its internal content area (which houses the login form) also does not visually appear rounded at its boundaries (as its boundaries are defined by the parent box). If the instruction was interpreted to mean the individual input fields themselves, these also remain sharp-edged in the "after" image.
*   **Other "main content boxes":** The instruction says "all main content boxes". While the 'vBulletin Message' panel is the most prominent example and explicitly mentioned, other potential "boxes" like the user login area at the top right, and the 'User Control Panel' / 'Forum Jump' sections at the bottom, also retain their perfectly sharp, square corners in the "after" image.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts regarding the absence of the intended change. The corners of the specified "main content boxes," particularly the large 'vBulletin Message' panel, show no visual difference between the "before" and "after" images. The instruction to apply rounded edges was not implemented visually.

**Final verdict:**
