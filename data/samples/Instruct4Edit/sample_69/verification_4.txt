Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header section. This will visually separate the header from the rest of the content.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernable shadow added to the header in the "after" image. The top section looks the same in both images.
3. There's no visible shadow. The change was not implemented.

Final verdict:
