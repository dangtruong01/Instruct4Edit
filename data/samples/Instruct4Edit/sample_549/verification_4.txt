Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the logo in the header smaller.
2. Visually comparing the images, I can't see any difference in the logo size in the header.
3. There is no ambiguity, but the instruction was not applied, or the difference is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
