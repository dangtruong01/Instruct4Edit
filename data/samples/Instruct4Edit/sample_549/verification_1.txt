Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the navigation links in the footer to a darker blue, presumably to increase their visibility.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see a noticeable difference in the color of the footer links. They appear to be the same light blue color in both images.
3. There is no visible change to the link colors in the footer, so the instruction has not been implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
