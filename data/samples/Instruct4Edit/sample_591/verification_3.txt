Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a thin, light gray border around the share buttons ("Teilen", "Tweet", "Flip it", "Mail", "Link").
2. Comparing the two images, the "after" image does not have any visible light gray borders around the share buttons.
3. The instruction is clear and unambiguous, and the absence of the border is clear.

Final verdict:
