Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the items in the "Schauspieler und Rollen" list. This means the vertical space between "Helen Mirren", "Ryan Reynolds", and "Daniel Brühl" should be larger in the second image.
2. By comparing the two images, it is difficult to perceive any increase in spacing between the "Schauspieler und Rollen" list items. They appear to be the same distance apart.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not clearly visible in the modified image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
