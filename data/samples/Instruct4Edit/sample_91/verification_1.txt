Here's my assessment:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to add a "light background shadow" to the main navigation bar located at the very top of the page. This shadow should visually separate the navigation bar from the rest of the page content, making it appear to float slightly or be distinct from the page background.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon careful comparison of both the "before" and "after" images, the area around and beneath the main navigation bar (containing "HOME ABOUT US SERVICES..." and the contact info) appears identical. There is no discernible shadow, drop shadow, or any visual effect that would make the navigation bar stand out more or suggest a change in its background or depth.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the absence of the requested change. The intended visual effect (a shadow) is entirely missing. Both images display the top navigation bar blending seamlessly with the white page background, without any visual separation or shadow as requested.

**Final verdict:**
