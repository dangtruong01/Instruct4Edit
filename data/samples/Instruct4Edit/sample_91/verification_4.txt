Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical empty space, or "breathing room," between the main page heading ("Prolotherapy vs. PRP Injections") and the beginning of the article's body text ("Prolotherapy and PRP therapy are both regenerative techniques."). Given the current layout, this means increasing the space between the date ("Apr 04, 2016") and the first paragraph of the main text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the entire block of main article text, starting with "Prolotherapy and PRP therapy...", has shifted downwards. This creates a noticeably larger white space between the date "Apr 04, 2016" and the first line of the article text compared to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was clear about the elements to separate, and the modification directly addresses this by increasing the vertical spacing where intended. The added space provides the requested "breathing room" between the introductory elements and the main content.
