Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between individual lines of text (often referred to as line-height or leading) within all paragraphs that make up the main article content. This change is specifically intended to enhance readability by making the text appear less dense.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the space between lines of text within all the main body paragraphs (from "Prolotherapy and PRP therapy are both regenerative techniques..." down to "...you can help you.") has been noticeably increased. The text blocks in the "after" image appear less compressed vertically and more open, directly corresponding to an increase in line-height. This applies consistently to all standard paragraphs and the bulleted list items within the article body.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The intended visual change has been clearly and consistently applied throughout the entirety of the main article body as instructed.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
