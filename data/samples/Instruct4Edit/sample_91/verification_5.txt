Here's my review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to enhance the readability and organization of the footer content. Specifically, it intends to clearly separate and align the various pieces of information (like contact details and links) to improve their scannability. This implies moving away from a potentially cramped or unstructured horizontal layout to a more spacious and aligned arrangement.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    In the "before" image, the footer elements (`4.78`, `PRIVACY`, `TERMS & CONDITIONS`, `ACCESSIBILITY`, `CONTACT US`) are all laid out horizontally on a single line at the very bottom, with minimal separation between them. They appear somewhat packed together.
    In the "after" image, a significant visual change has been applied to the footer. The page number (`4.78`) remains on the left, but the navigational links (`PRIVACY`, `TERMS & CONDITIONS`, `ACCESSIBILITY`, `CONTACT US`) have been distinctly moved to the right side of the footer. Crucially, they are now stacked vertically, each on its own line, and are clearly right-aligned. This creates a well-defined, organized block of links.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities.
    *   **"Clearly separated"**: The links are now separated from the page number by a significant horizontal distance, and from each other by vertical spacing, making distinct visual items.
    *   **"Aligned"**: The links are now consistently right-aligned, forming a clean vertical column.
    *   **"Making them easier to scan"**: The vertical stacking and clear alignment undoubtedly improve scannability compared to the single-line horizontal layout. Each link is now immediately distinguishable.

The visual implementation perfectly matches the intent of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
