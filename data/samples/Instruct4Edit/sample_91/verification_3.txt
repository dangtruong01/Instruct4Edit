Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aimed to transform the "Request Appointment" text in the header from a plain text link into a more prominent button. This was to be achieved by giving it a solid background color and slightly rounded corners.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, "REQUEST APPOINTMENT" is plain black text, appearing as a standard navigation link. In the "after" image, it is encapsulated within a solid blue background, and the corners of this background are distinctly rounded, transforming it into a clear call-to-action button. This significantly increases its visual prominence compared to its original state and the surrounding text links.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The solid background color (blue) is clearly applied, and the corners are visibly (though subtly) rounded, fulfilling both parts of the instruction precisely. The overall goal of making it "more visually prominent" is also unequivocally achieved.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
