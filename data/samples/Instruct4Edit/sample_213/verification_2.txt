Here's my cautious review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to modify the existing "prominent dark blue borders" around the main sections and content boxes. The desired change is to "soften" these borders. This softening was suggested to be achieved by using "lighter lines" or "subtle shadows" to provide separation instead of the current prominent dark lines. Key areas to look at would be the main content wrapper (the large red-bordered box) and the login panel in the top right.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon a very detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible visual difference in the borders of the main sections or content boxes.
*   The dark border around the top-right "User Name / Password" login box appears identical in both images.
*   The dark border around the large "vBulletin Message" content box appears identical in both images.
*   The internal borders of input fields and other elements also show no change.
No lighter lines or subtle shadows have been introduced to soften or replace the existing dark borders.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was to *change* the visual appearance of the borders by *softening* them. Visually, no such change has been applied. The borders remain as prominent and dark in the "after" image as they were in the "before" image.

**Final verdict:**
