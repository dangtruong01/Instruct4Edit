Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to increase the *vertical spacing* between major distinct content blocks (header, navigation bar, central message area, and footer) to provide more breathing room. This means there should be more empty vertical space separating these large sections in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, no discernible increase in vertical spacing between the identified main content blocks can be observed:
    *   The spacing between the top "header" section (containing the logo and login form) and the red "navigation bar" (Register, FAQ, etc.) remains unchanged.
    *   The spacing between the red "navigation bar" and the main "central message area" (the large red-bordered "vBulletin Message" box) remains unchanged.
    *   The spacing between the bottom of the "central message area" and the "footer" (the red bar with copyright information) remains unchanged.
    Visually, the vertical layout and distances between these primary sections appear identical in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction appears to have not been applied at all. The vertical spacing between the main content blocks is precisely the same in both the original and the modified images.

Final verdict:
