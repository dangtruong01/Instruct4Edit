**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the color of the "Cipher Simian" text located in the very bottom section (footer) of the page. The goal is to make it a more neutral and easily readable shade.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the "Cipher Simian" text at the bottom appears to be a dark green or teal color. In the "after" image, this same text has clearly been changed to a black or very dark grey color. This new shade is indeed more neutral compared to the original distinct green.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction specifically targets the "text in the very bottom section," which is clearly "Cipher Simian" as the only text element there. The color change is evident and aligns with the description of becoming "more neutral and easily readable."

**Final verdict:**
