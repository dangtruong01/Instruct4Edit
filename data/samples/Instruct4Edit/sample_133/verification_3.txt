Here's the analysis:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to make the right-hand column (referred to as the "advertisement area") visually shorter if its content doesn't fill the space. Currently, it's implied that this area maintains a fixed, taller height, possibly aligning with the main content's height, even if its own content is short. The desired change is for the right column's content to determine its own vertical space, making it visually stop where its content ends.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** The content in the right column (`ádfdHH...` to `...åÄIv`) visually extends downwards to approximately the same vertical level as the content in the left column, despite appearing to have fewer lines of actual text content. This suggests its container or "box" was indeed fixed or stretching to match the height of the left column.
*   **After Image:** The content in the right column (`ádfdHH...` to `...åÄIv`) now clearly ends much higher on the page, significantly above where the left column's content concludes. This visually demonstrates that the vertical space occupied by the right column has *shrunk* to exactly fit its content, rather than extending further down unnecessarily.

This is a clear visual manifestation of the height adjusting to fit content.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No significant doubts or ambiguities. While there isn't a literal "box" drawn around the content, the change in the vertical extent of the right column's content area (compared to the left column) perfectly illustrates the instruction being applied. The visual evidence strongly supports that the area is no longer a "fixed, tall box" but has adjusted its height to its content.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
