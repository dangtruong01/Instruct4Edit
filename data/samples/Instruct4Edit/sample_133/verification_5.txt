**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states to make the advertisement at the bottom of the screen span the full width of the visible area, implying it was previously only half width. The intended change is an increase in the width of this element from half to full.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, the green bar at the very bottom, labeled "Cipher Simian", already spans the entire visible width of the content area. It is not half width.
    *   In the "after" image, this green bar is visually identical to the "before" image; it still spans the full width.
    *   Therefore, no visual change in width (from half to full) is observed between the two images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes. The premise of the instruction ("rather than only half") does not match the visual reality of the "before" image. The element in question was already full width. Since the instruction describes a transformation *from* a half-width state *to* a full-width state, and the initial state was not half-width, the described transformation could not and did not visually occur. The two images are identical in the relevant area.
