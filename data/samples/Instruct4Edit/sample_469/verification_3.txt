Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to modernize the rounded corners of the search navigation bar. This implies reducing the radius of the rounding or making them visually less pronounced.
2. There is no visible search navigation bar or area with rounded corners in the images provided. Thus, I can't verify that the changes were implemented.
3. I can't find any rounded corners to compare.

Final verdict:
