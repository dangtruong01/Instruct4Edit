Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the font size of the main content text, which refers to the body text within the search results.
2. By comparing the two images, there is no visible difference in the font size of the main content text. The text in the search results, such as the post content and author information, appears to be the same size in both images.
3. There is no visible change in font size, so the instruction has not been implemented.

Final verdict:
