Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to "Expand the width of the large explanatory paragraph about the map extracts to take up more space across the page." This means the paragraph's bounding box should be wider in the "after" image, causing the text to wrap differently and occupy fewer lines if the content length remains the same.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Target paragraph identification:** The paragraph in question is: "These extracts are taken from the current Ordnance Survey 1:50,000 (one and a quarter inch to one mile map) published on their web site. They should cover the areas where most of us lived. Click on the thumbnails to enlarge them. The enlarged maps are approximately double the scale of the printed original map, so each has an on-screen scale of about two and a half inches to one mile."
    *   **Comparison:** Upon close inspection, the width of this paragraph in the "after" image is precisely the same as in the "before" image. The text wraps at the exact same points, and the paragraph occupies the same number of lines and horizontal space. No expansion of width is visible.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities; the requested change is entirely missing. The two images are visually identical in terms of the width of the specified paragraph.
