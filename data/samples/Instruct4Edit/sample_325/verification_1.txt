Here's the review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the arrangement of the small map images from a staggered, diagonal layout to a clean, horizontally aligned row-based presentation.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is very clearly visible. In the "before" image, the five small map images are arranged in a diagonal, staircase-like "staggered effect". In the "after" image, these same five images are now organized into two distinct, neatly aligned rows: the first row contains three images, and the second row contains two images, with clear horizontal alignment within each row.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The "staggered effect" has been completely removed, and the images are now neatly aligned in rows as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
