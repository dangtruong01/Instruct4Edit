Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing in two specific areas within the header:
    *   Between the "main school name" ("Aberdare Boys' Grammar School") and the "map title" ("Map of The Cynon Valley, 2003").
    *   Between the "map title" ("Map of The Cynon Valley, 2003") and the "navigation links" ("Back to previous page | Home page").

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Between the main school name and the map title:** Upon close inspection, the vertical space between "Aberdare Boys' Grammar School" and "Map of The Cynon Valley, 2003" has indeed increased. The map title has been shifted downwards slightly relative to the school name. While subtle, it is a visible increase in spacing.
    *   **Between the map title and the navigation links:** The vertical space between "Map of The Cynon Valley, 2003" and "Back to previous page | Home page" has significantly increased. The navigation links are noticeably further down in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. This change is very clear and pronounced.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or missing elements. Both specified vertical spaces have been increased in the "after" image. The instruction simply asked to "increase" the space, without specifying a minimum amount or a dramatic change. Both increases are visually discernible, with one being more prominent than the other. The instruction was fully addressed for all mentioned elements.

Final verdict:
