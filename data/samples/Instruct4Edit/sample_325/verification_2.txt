Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests that the text-based hyperlinks "Back to previous page" and "Home page" be transformed into visual elements that appear like buttons. This transformation specifically requires adding a solid background color to these links and ensuring there is visible spacing (padding) between the text content and the edges of the newly formed button shape. This change should apply to all occurrences of these specific links.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the links ("Back to previous page" and "Home page" at the top, and "Back to previous page" at the bottom) are simple, underlined text.
    *   In the "after" image, all identified instances of these links have been converted into distinct rectangular shapes with a dark gray solid background and white text.
    *   Crucially, there is noticeable padding (spacing) around the text within these new button-like elements, which was absent in the original links.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, based purely on the visual information and the provided instruction, there are no doubts or ambiguities.
    *   "distinct button-like appearance": Achieved. The elements clearly look like buttons now.
    *   "solid background": Achieved. They have a dark gray solid background.
    *   "some spacing around the text": Achieved. There is clear padding around the text.
    *   The change was applied to both "Back to previous page" (both instances) and "Home page" links, as specified.

**Final verdict:**
