**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to modify the background color of the entire page to a new shade that is visually "lighter" and "less harsh" than the original.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the overall background color of the page appears to be identical in both. There is no discernible visual difference in the lightness, harshness, or hue of the background between the two images. Both images display the exact same shade of light grey as the background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is significant doubt. The instruction explicitly states "Change the overall background color." Since there is no perceptible change in the background color between the "before" and "after" images, it indicates that the instruction was either not implemented or the change, if any, is imperceptible to the human eye, thus failing the "clearly visible" criterion. The original background is already a relatively light grey, but the instruction implied a *change* to a *different*, lighter, and less harsh tone, which is not visually evident.
