Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header. This would typically be a box-shadow style applied to the header element.
2. Visually comparing the two images, I can see no discernible difference in the header's appearance. There is no apparent shadow added in the "after" image.
3. The change is not visible and I have doubts it has been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
