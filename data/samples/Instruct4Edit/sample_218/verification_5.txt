**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to increase the vertical space between each individual entry within the "Popular Posts" section (labeled "Entradas populares") in the right sidebar. This means the gap between the end of one post's content and the beginning of the next post's title should be larger.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the vertical spacing between the popular post entries (e.g., between "¿Por qué las enfermeras se van a Inglaterra?" and "Se busca médico para trabajo indefinido...", or between "Se busca médico para trabajo indefinido..." and "El como de un cardiólogo") remains identical. There is no discernible increase in vertical space between these elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction explicitly stated to "increase" the space, but visually, the space has not changed at all. The implementation is missing entirely.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
