Here's my review based on your instruction:

**Instruction:** Make all the circular sharing buttons, like the one below the article title, slightly larger and give them a faint background fill to make them more noticeable.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Identify all circular buttons intended for sharing content. The instruction points to the one below the article title as an example.
    *   Increase their size slightly.
    *   Apply a faint background fill to these buttons.
    *   The overall goal is to enhance their visibility.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Target Element (below article title):** In the "before" image, the circular button below "De mudanza. ¡Nos vemos!" is extremely faint, almost an outline, and barely visible. In the "after" image, this button is noticeably larger, and it has a distinct, faint light gray/beige solid background fill, making it significantly more prominent and noticeable.
    *   **"all the circular sharing buttons"**: I have scanned both images carefully.
        *   The button below the article title is the only clear "circular sharing button" present on the page. Its size and fill have been changed as instructed.
        *   There is also a circular placeholder for an avatar in the comments section below "Anónimo ha dicho que...". While this is a circular element, it is typically an avatar display, not a "sharing button". However, this circular element *also* appears slightly larger and has a faint background fill in the "after" image, consistent with the *style* of the change applied to the sharing button. This indicates the design change might have been applied to similar circular elements, even if not explicitly "sharing buttons". But focusing strictly on "circular *sharing* buttons," only the one below the title fits the description, and it has been correctly modified.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   No doubts regarding the primary example button (below the article title) – it clearly meets both size and fill requirements and is more noticeable.
    *   The "all" part of the instruction is met because there are no other clearly identifiable "circular *sharing* buttons" on the page that were missed. The change to the avatar placeholder, while visually consistent, is beyond the scope of "sharing buttons" and therefore doesn't indicate a failure to implement the instruction for its specified target.

**Final verdict:**
- ✅ Fully Applied
