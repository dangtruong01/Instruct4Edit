Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to update the "Park Info" heading's font to be more prominent and modern. This implies changing the typeface, possibly the size, and potentially the weight (boldness) of the font.
2. Comparing the two images, there's no noticeable difference in the font used for the "Park Information" heading. It appears to be the same font, size, and weight in both images.
3. There are no apparent changes made to the font of the "Park Information" heading.

Final verdict:
