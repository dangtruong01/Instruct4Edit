Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the navigation links bigger and easier to read. This implies increasing the font size and possibly adjusting the font weight to improve readability.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no noticeable difference in the size or readability of the navigation links. They appear to be the same size and weight in both images.
3. There is no visible change in the modified image that addresses the instruction. The navigation links remain the same size.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
