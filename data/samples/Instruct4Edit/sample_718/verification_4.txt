Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the thickness of the separator line under the main heading, presumably "Park Information".
2. Comparing the two images, the separator line under "Park Information" appears to be visually identical in thickness. No change is apparent.
3. There are no ambiguities; the instruction is straightforward, but the modification hasn't been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
