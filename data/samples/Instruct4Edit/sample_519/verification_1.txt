Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation bar stick to the top of the screen when scrolling. Since there is no scrolling demonstrated in the image, it is not possible to determine if the navbar is sticking or not.
2. It's impossible to determine if the navigation bar is sticky based on the static images provided.
3. The instruction relies on dynamic behavior (scrolling) that is not visible in the static before/after images.

Final verdict:
