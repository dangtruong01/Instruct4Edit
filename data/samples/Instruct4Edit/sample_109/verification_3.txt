Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation links at the top of the page. This means the horizontal gaps between the elements labeled as navigation links at the very top of the page should be larger in the "after" image.
2. Comparing the two images, I don't observe any difference in the spacing between the navigation links at the top of the page.
3. There's no visible change in the spacing, therefore, the instruction wasn't applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
