Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the font size within the search input field.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font size in the search input field appears to be negligibly larger, if at all.
3. Although it is very subtle, there might be a very slight difference in font size, but it's hard to be certain. It is also possible that the perceived change is due to image rendering.

Final verdict:
