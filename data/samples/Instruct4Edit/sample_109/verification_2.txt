Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle gray border to all tables to visually separate them. I need to verify if this has been applied.
2. After examining the images, there are no tables present in both images, so it's impossible to apply the changes or see any difference.
3. There are no tables to apply the instruction to.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
