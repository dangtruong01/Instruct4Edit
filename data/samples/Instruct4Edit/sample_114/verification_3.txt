Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for visual separation between the two tables, presumably to improve readability. This could involve adding whitespace, borders, or backgrounds.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, I see no visual differences between the two tables in either image.
3. The tables remain visually adjacent to each other without any added separators.

Final verdict:
