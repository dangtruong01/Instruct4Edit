Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow effect to be added to the main content area to make it stand out.
2. Comparing the before and after images, I can't identify any visible shadow around the main content area (the central white block containing text and image).
3. The change isn't present, or at least not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
