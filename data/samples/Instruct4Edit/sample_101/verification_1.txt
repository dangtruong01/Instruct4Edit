Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a change in the color scheme to a brighter, more modern palette. This implies a change in the overall colors used in the website's design.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the overall color palette doesn't seem to have significantly changed. The images appear to have similar color tones and hues.
3. It's possible that the changes are very subtle, but the overall look and feel remain very similar. It is not clear if any changes have been made to the color palette.

Final verdict:
