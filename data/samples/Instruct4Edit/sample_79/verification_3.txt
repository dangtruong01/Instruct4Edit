Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main article content easier to read by adding more vertical space (also known as line height, leading, or paragraph spacing) between individual paragraphs. This creates more distinct visual breaks between blocks of text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the vertical gaps between paragraphs within the main article content are noticeably larger than in the "before" image. Each paragraph now stands out more distinctly, making the text less dense and potentially easier to scan and comprehend. The application of this increased spacing appears consistent throughout the main article body.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is precisely applied to the specified area ("paragraphs in the main article content") and not to other elements like the header, footer, or list items, which aligns with the specificity of the instruction. The increased spacing is consistent and effective.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
