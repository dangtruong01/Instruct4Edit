**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the background color of the horizontal bar at the very bottom of the page (which contains the text "Theme by Out the Box") darker. The purpose is to improve the readability and prominence of the text within this bar.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible. In the "before" image, the bottom bar has a very light grey background. In the "after" image, this same bar's background color has been changed to a much darker shade (appears to be a dark grey or near-black). Consequently, the light-colored text "Theme by Out the Box" now contrasts significantly better with the darker background, making it stand out more clearly.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The specific element targeted ("the very bottom bar in the footer") was correctly identified and modified. The requested action ("darken the background color") was executed, and the desired outcome ("text stands out more clearly") was achieved.

**Final verdict:**
