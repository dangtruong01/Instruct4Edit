Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Add a visible border around each of the linked items in the sidebar to make them appear as separate blocks.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to visually encapsulate each individual text link within the sidebar area with a distinct border. The goal is to transform these plain text links into visually separate, block-like elements, improving their perceived clickability and organization.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The "before" image displays the items in the sidebar (e.g., "Situs Slot", "parlay4d", "agen slot online", "Daftar Situs Judi Slot Online") as plain text, without any surrounding borders. They appear as a continuous list.
    *   **After Image:** The "after" image clearly shows that every single item identified as a "linked item" in the sidebar now has a distinct, light gray border around it. For instance, "Situs Slot", "judi online slot", "Daftar Slot Online", and others are now enclosed within rectangular boxes. This change is very visible and consistent across all relevant elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities.
    *   The borders are clearly "visible".
    *   They are applied "around each of the linked items" in the sidebar.
    *   They successfully "make them appear as separate blocks," fulfilling the intended visual segmentation. Every item that was a simple text link in the before image now has a border, making it a distinct block.
