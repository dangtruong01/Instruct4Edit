Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended for the text color of the main navigation menu to be changed to a darker shade, specifically to improve its contrast against the background. This implies an existing navigation menu whose text color needed modification.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In the "before" image, there is no main navigation menu present. In the "after" image, a main navigation menu (containing "NEWS", "BUSINESS", "CASINO", "SPORTS", "MISCELLANEOUS") has been introduced. The text color of this newly added menu is dark and provides good contrast against the white background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant ambiguity. The instruction "Adjust the text color in the main navigation menu..." presumes the existence of a main navigation menu whose text color needed "adjusting." However, in the "before" image, no such main navigation menu is visible. The "after" image shows a *newly added* main navigation menu. While this *newly added* menu does have dark text with good contrast, the instruction was not to "Add a main navigation menu with dark text" but to "Adjust the text color" of an *existing* one. Since the element did not exist to be adjusted, the instruction as literally stated ("Adjust the text color...") cannot be considered fully applied in the sense of modifying an existing attribute.
