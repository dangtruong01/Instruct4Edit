As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, here is my assessment:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states the intended visual change is to give the main site title, 'Hailsham Grange', a more vibrant color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, 'Hailsham Grange' is rendered in a muted grey tone. In the "after" image, the text 'Hailsham Grange' has been changed to a distinct shade of magenta/purple. This new color is significantly more vibrant and stands out more than the original grey.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The entire text of the main site title has been changed, and the new color unambiguously fits the description of "more vibrant" compared to the original.

**Final verdict:**
