Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The links in the footer should have a different color.

2.  **Visibility:** The links in the footer of the "after" image are now blue, while in the "before" image, they are black.

3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The instruction is about the footer links. The links in the "after" image are colored blue.

**Final Verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
