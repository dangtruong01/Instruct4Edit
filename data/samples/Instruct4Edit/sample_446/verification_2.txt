Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the "Create Ad" button to a brighter, more prominent color. This implies a change in the button's fill color to make it visually stand out more.
2. In the "after" image, the "Create Ad" button appears to be a brighter yellow color compared to the "before" image, where it appears to be a paler or more subdued yellow.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The button is clearly visible in both images, and the color change is apparent.

Final verdict:
