Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to slightly reduce the spacing between the navigation links in the header.
2. Visually comparing the two images, it's difficult to definitively confirm that the spacing between "Boats for sale", "Sell your boat", "News & Reviews", and "Help & FAQs" has been reduced. The change, if any, is too subtle to be confidently identified.
3. Due to the subtle nature of the potential change, it's difficult to confirm if the instruction was fully implemented.

Final verdict:
