2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the background color of the navigation bar is noticeably a dark blue in the "after" image, whereas in the "before" image it was white.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The change is clear and unambiguous.
