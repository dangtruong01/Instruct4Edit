Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the spacing between articles in the content section. This means the vertical distance separating each article (title, date, and text) should be greater in the "after" image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the spacing between the articles appears noticeably increased in the modified image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clear and directly addresses the instruction.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
