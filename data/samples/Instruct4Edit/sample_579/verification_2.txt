Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for more visual separation between the table headers and the data rows by using a darker shade or a different background color for the headers.
2. Comparing the two images, I don't see any visible change in the table header's background color or shade. The data rows and header rows share the same background color and tone in both images.
3. There is no visible change applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
