Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to style the "Total Pageview" counter to be more prominent and visually appealing. This could include changes to font size, weight, color, background, or any other visual attribute that makes the element stand out.
2. Visually comparing the images, it's difficult to determine what the "Total Pageview" counter refers to exactly. While there is an element labeled "Total Pageview," there are no readily apparent style changes related to it between the "before" and "after" images. It looks exactly the same.
3. It's unclear what aspect of the "Total Pageview" element should be styled. Furthermore, there is no indication that any styling changes were made between the two images.

Final verdict:
