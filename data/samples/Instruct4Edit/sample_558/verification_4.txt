Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main article cards. This means the cards should visually "pop out" slightly more due to the shadow effect.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, I do not see any noticeable shadow effect added to the main article cards.
3. There is no visible shadow applied to the main article cards.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
