Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction was to add a subtle arrow icon next to the "Скачать порно" text to clarify that it functions as a button to open a menu/can be expanded.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Upon careful comparison of the "Скачать порно" button in both the "before" and "after" images, no arrow icon has been added next to the text. The button appears visually identical in both states.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the core instruction of adding an arrow icon has not been implemented at all.

Final verdict:
- ❌ Not Applied
