Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to visually separate specific content blocks, namely "where categories and models are listed, and individual comments," from the overall page background. This was to be achieved by adding either a "light border" or a "very subtle background shade" to these blocks.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **Categories and Models Section:** In the "before" image, the area containing "Категории:" and "Модели:" (excluding the pre-existing light gray buttons/links) blends directly into the dark background. In the "after" image, this entire block of content now has a subtle, lighter gray background shade, which distinctly separates it from the surrounding dark background.
    *   **Individual Comments Section:** Similarly, in the "before" image, the area below the "Комментарии" yellow header, which includes the listed comment ("17.04.19 09:50 Japanes") and the "Комментарий:" label with its input fields, blends seamlessly with the dark background. In the "after" image, this entire section also features the same subtle, lighter gray background shade, creating a clear visual block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction precisely targeted "where categories and models are listed, and individual comments." Both these areas have received a "very subtle background shade" as requested, effectively achieving the desired visual separation without being intrusive. The change is consistent with the wording and intent of the instruction.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
