**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the spacing around the video thumbnails in the "Рекомендуем посмотреть" section. This means either more horizontal space between thumbnails, more vertical space between rows of thumbnails, or both, to create a more "evenly spaced grid" and give them "more breathing room."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close inspection, the arrangement, sizing, and spacing of all video thumbnails within the "Рекомендуем посмотреть" section (including the five thumbnails in the first row and the one thumbnail in the second row) are identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernable increase in breathing room or adjustment to form a more evenly spaced grid.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the *lack* of change. The elements in question are pixel-perfect identical between the two images. The instruction to adjust spacing and create more breathing room was not implemented visually.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
