**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   To make the text input box for comments less plain, specifically by giving it a slightly darker background color or a subtle inner shadow, to better integrate it with the page design.
    *   To ensure the 'send' button associated with the comments is clearly distinguishable.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Text Input Box:** In the "before" image, there were two small, plain white input boxes. In the "after" image, these have been replaced by a single, larger text area. This new text area has a distinct dark grey background, which is significantly darker than the original white and visually integrates better with the overall dark theme of the page. It also appears to have a very subtle border or slight inner shadow, making it look recessed and more "integrated."
    *   **'Send' Button:** In the "before" image, there was no 'send' button visible at all for the comments section. In the "after" image, a new button labeled "Отправить" (Send) has been added below the text area. This button has a bright orange background and white text, making it highly contrasting and undeniably "clearly distinguishable" against the dark page background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The instruction referred to "the text input box" (singular), while the original had two. The design change consolidated these into a single, larger, and appropriately styled text area, which is a very effective way to address the instruction for the comment input.
    *   The instruction implied an existing 'send' button that needed to be made more distinguishable. However, since no 'send' button was present in the 'before' image, the addition of a brand new, highly distinguishable 'send' button (labeled "Отправить") fully addresses the core intent of making sure such a button *is* clearly distinguishable, even if it meant creating it from scratch. The outcome is a clear improvement directly aligned with the instruction's goal.

**Final verdict:**
