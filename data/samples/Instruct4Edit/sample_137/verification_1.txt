Here's the review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the plain text links at the top of the page into more visually distinct elements that resemble buttons. This involves giving them a clear, more noticeable background and a subtle visual cue (like a shadow or border) to create a "slightly raised" effect, making them stand out from the page's dark background.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the links ("Порно скачать бесплатно", etc.) are simply orange-yellow text directly on the dark gray page background, appearing flat.
    *   In the "after" image, each of these links now has a distinct light gray rectangular background with a slightly darker gray border. This new background makes them significantly more noticeable than before.
    *   The combination of the light gray background and the darker border gives them a clear, defined shape that resembles a button, moving them away from a "flat" appearance. While the "raised" effect is subtle, it's achieved through the defined shape and contrast, fulfilling the "slightly raised, button-like appearance" requirement.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no significant doubts or missing elements. All the links at the very top have been consistently modified. The "slightly raised" effect is indeed subtle, but the instruction asked for "slightly" and "button-like," which has been achieved by giving them a distinct background and border that clearly defines them as clickable elements, no longer "flat" text.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
