Here's the comparison and verification:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to add clear, descriptive text labels to the three previously blank buttons located in the sidebar, specifically below the "FOLLOW THIS BLOG" section. This is intended to inform users about the function of each button, which appear to act as tab controls for content display (e.g., popular posts, recent posts).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, there are three identical, unlabeled grey rectangular buttons in the sidebar. In the "after" image, these same buttons now contain the text labels "RANDOM", "RECENT", and "POPULAR" respectively, from left to right.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction specifically referred to "blank buttons" functioning as "tab controls in the sidebar". The identified buttons perfectly fit this description, and the added labels are descriptive, clarifying their purpose. The implementation is complete and unambiguous.

**Final verdict:**
