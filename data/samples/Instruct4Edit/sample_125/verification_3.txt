Here is the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The primary goal is to change the text alignment of the main article content from justified to left-aligned. This means the right edge of the text paragraphs should become ragged instead of straight.
    *   The secondary goal is to slightly increase the vertical spacing (line-height) between lines within the main article content to improve readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Alignment:** In the "before" image, the main article paragraphs (e.g., "Pendaftaran CPNS Di Semarang Telah Dibuka...", "Pendaftaran CPNS di Semarang tanggal 25...") clearly show justified text with both left and right edges appearing straight and aligned. In the "after" image, the left edge remains straight, but the right edge of these paragraphs is now visibly ragged and uneven. This confirms that the text has been successfully set to left-aligned.
    *   **Line Spacing:** Upon close inspection and comparison of corresponding paragraphs in both images, there is a subtle but discernible increase in the vertical space between lines in the "after" image. The text appears marginally less dense vertically, indicating that the line spacing has been slightly increased, consistent with the instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The change in alignment is unambiguous and clearly visible.
    *   The increase in vertical spacing, while "slight" as per the instruction, is also visually present and not open to significant doubt. It is not a drastic change, but it's there.
