Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color of the breadcrumbs section to a lighter color. This is to improve the readability of the links.
2. In the after image, the background color of the section that contains "Home / Replacement Screws / TV Stand Screws / TCL / 75S470G" appears to be unchanged, remaining the same dark grey.
3. The background color is still dark, so the change was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
