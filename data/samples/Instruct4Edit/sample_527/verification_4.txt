Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow effect behind the "Reasons" boxes (presumably referring to the boxes that say "ONLY $3.49 DOLLARS", "ALWAYS FAST SHIPPING", and "30 DAYS FREE RETURNS").
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible shadow effect added to the boxes in the after image. The boxes look the same in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself. The change is simply not visible in the after image.

Final verdict:
