Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to remove the grayscale effect from the product image thumbnails on the left.
2. Comparing the before and after images, I can see a slight increase in color saturation in the thumbnails on the left in the after image. The "before" image appears to have a grayscale or desaturated effect, while the "after" image has a subtle color presence.
3. The difference is very subtle, and there is no way to be absolutely sure.

Final verdict:
