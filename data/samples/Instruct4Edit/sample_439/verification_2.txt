1. The instruction is to add a subtle gray border around the main content area.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible gray border around the main content area in the after image compared to the before image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
