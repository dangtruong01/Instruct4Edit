Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires changing the color of the links to a more vibrant blue. This means identifying the links and changing their color to a brighter shade of blue.
2. By comparing the before and after images, I can see that the links have changed from a dark, almost black color to a brighter blue color. This indicates that the change has been applied.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible and consistent with the instruction.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
