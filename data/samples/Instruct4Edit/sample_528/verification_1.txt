Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the logo bigger and more prominent in the header. The "before" image doesn't have a logo, and the "after" image also doesn't have a logo.
2. There is no visible change because there is no logo in either image.
3. There is no logo to be enlarged, so the instruction cannot be applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
