Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to visually highlight the "recent posts" widget. This should be achieved either with a background color change or a border.
2. Comparing the two images, the "recent posts" widget (located at the bottom left) does not show any change in background color or border.
3. There is no ambiguity. The change is simply not present.

Final verdict:
