Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the width of the main content area. This means the text, images, and other elements within the central part of the page should be narrower than before.
2. Comparing the two images, it's impossible to determine if the width of the content area was reduced. The second image is mostly empty, and does not provide enough information to make the comparison.
3. There are ambiguities and missing elements in the after image.

Final verdict:
