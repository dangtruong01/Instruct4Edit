Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main navigation links. These links are located at the top of the page.
2. Looking at the before and after images, I cannot see any difference in the shadowing around the main navigation links.
3. There is no visible shadow added to the main navigation links in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
