Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing between the article title ("Los comercios interesados...") and the post metadata (author and date).
2. Visually comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible difference in the spacing between the article title and the post metadata.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself. The instruction is to modify the spacing, which can be easily identified.

Final verdict:
