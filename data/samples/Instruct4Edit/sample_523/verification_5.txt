Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header area. This shadow should visually separate the header from the content below it, giving the impression that the header is slightly elevated.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernible shadow effect added to the header area in the "after" image. It appears identical to the "before" image in this region.
3. There are no visible changes that would indicate a subtle shadow has been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
