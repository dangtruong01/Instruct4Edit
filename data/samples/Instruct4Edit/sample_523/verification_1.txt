Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle hover effect, likely a light background color change, on the main menu items. These items are "NOTICIAS", "INVERTIR EN CALATAYUD", "EMPRENDEDORES", "COMERCIO", "INDUSTRIA", "VIVERO MUNICIPAL", "PROGRAMAS EMPRENDEDORES", and "CONTACTO".
2. By comparing the two images, I cannot identify any visual changes on the main menu items when hovered. The appearance remains the same in both images.
3. Since there is no discernible change in the appearance of the main menu items when hovered, the instruction has not been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
