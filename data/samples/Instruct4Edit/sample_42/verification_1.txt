Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** Increase the vertical space between the main heading (title) and the subheading (subtitle).
2.  **Change Visibility:** Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no clear visible change. The spacing between the title and subtitle remains the same.
3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The instruction appears to not have been executed.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
