Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the titles in the "Want To Keep Reading?" section bolder and slightly larger.
2. Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, the titles in the "Want To Keep Reading?" section appear to be visually identical. There's no noticeable difference in font size or boldness.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change doesn't seem to be implemented.

Final verdict:
