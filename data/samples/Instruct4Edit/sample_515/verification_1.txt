Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires a change to the main navigation bar. This includes giving it a light green background and adding a subtle shadow.
2. By comparing the two images, it is not possible to verify if the main navigation bar was modified to include a light green background color and a subtle shadow.
3. It's unclear whether the navigation bar was changed since the images look identical in the relevant area.

Final verdict:
