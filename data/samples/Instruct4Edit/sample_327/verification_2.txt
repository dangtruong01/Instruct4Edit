**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the horizontal spacing between the items in the main navigation menu (e.g., "AEG", "ASKO", "Bosch oppvaskmaskin", etc.) which is displayed in the black bar.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the horizontal gaps between each navigation item are noticeably larger than in the "before" image. For instance, the space between "ASKO" and "Bosch oppvaskmaskin", or "Miele" and "Siemens oppvaskmaskin", has been expanded significantly. The items now appear more spread out across the black navigation bar.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was straightforward, and the visual change clearly and consistently implements the requested increase in horizontal spacing between *each* item in the identified main navigation menu.

**Final verdict:**
