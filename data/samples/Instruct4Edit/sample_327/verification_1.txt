**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main content area of the webpage wider. This means reducing the horizontal margins or padding on the left and right sides of the overall page content, effectively allowing the content block to occupy more of the screen's width. The term "slightly" indicates a noticeable but not drastic increase in width.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "after" image, the entire main content block (from the "Oppvaskmaskin" title and search bar down to the footer) has expanded horizontally.
    *   The left edge of the content (e.g., the "AEG" tab, the start of text paragraphs) is closer to the left side of the browser window in the "after" image than in the "before" image.
    *   Similarly, the right edge of the content (e.g., the "Whirlpool" tab, the right sidebar) is closer to the right side of the browser window in the "after" image.
    *   The expansion is consistent across all main content elements, giving the impression of "more breathing room horizontally" for the text and elements within the main column. The change is subtle but definitively present, aligning with "slightly."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The entire page content area, not just isolated elements, has been horizontally expanded as instructed. The change is consistently applied and achieves the desired "breathing room."

**Final verdict:**
