Here's the analysis:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to streamline the visual separation between content blocks/articles. Specifically, it intends to remove a redundant or "duplicate" horizontal line that appears at the very end of each article section, ensuring only a single, clear horizontal separator remains.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **First Article (ASKO oppvaskmaskin):** In the "before" image, there is a horizontal line after "Se kort instruksjonsvideo om modellen (3 minutter)", followed by the text "Skrevet i ASKO | Merket med varmtvann", and then *another* horizontal line. This second line is the "duplicate". In the "after" image, this second horizontal line is completely removed.
    *   **Second Article (Miele G 4203 SCU):** The exact same pattern is observed here. In the "before" image, a duplicate horizontal line appears after "Skrevet i Miele | Merket med stål, varmtvann". In the "after" image, this duplicate line has been removed, leaving only one separator.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was precise, and the implementation is visually accurate. The duplicate lines are gone, and a single, clear separator remains in each instance.

**Final verdict:**
