**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims for the addition of social media sharing buttons. These buttons should be:
    *   "Prominent": Visually distinct and noticeable to encourage user interaction.
    *   "Social media sharing buttons": Functionally allowing sharing on social platforms, and visually presented as buttons (implying more than plain text links, e.g., with icons, distinct styling).
    *   "Right below the article's main content": Specific placement immediately after the article text.
    *   "Before the post navigation": Specific placement before any elements typically found after an article like "next post/previous post" links or post metadata.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Visibility of new elements:** Yes, in the "after" image, a new section titled "Share This Article!" appears, followed by text links: "Facebook", "Twitter", "LinkedIn", "Email". These elements are entirely absent in the "before" image.
    *   **Placement relative to content:** The new section is placed immediately after the last paragraph of the article content ("How to keep that A/C cool and running in the hot summer months"). This aligns with "right below the article's main content".
    *   **Placement relative to post navigation:** In the "before" image, the text "This entry was posted in News and tagged AC Repair. This is Revolution!" appears directly after the content. In the "after" image, the "Share This Article!" section and sharing links are inserted *before* this "entry posted" line. While explicit "post navigation" (like "Previous/Next Post" buttons) is not visible, placing the sharing elements before this post metadata aligns with the "before the post navigation" part of the instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **"Prominent":** This is the main point of contention. The instruction specifically asks for "prominent" buttons. While the "Share This Article!" heading draws some attention, the actual sharing elements are simple, unstyled text links ("Facebook", "Twitter", etc.). They lack visual emphasis (e.g., distinct background, icons, larger font, bolding) typically associated with "prominent" UI elements designed to grab attention and encourage action. From a visual UI/UX perspective, plain text links are generally not considered "prominent" compared to graphical buttons or clearly styled clickable areas.
    *   **"Buttons":** The instruction specifies "buttons". While text links are clickable elements and can function as buttons, the term "buttons" in a visual UI/UX context often implies a distinct graphical representation (e.g., a rectangular shape, an icon, a background color) that differentiates them from regular text and visually signals their interactive nature. The implementation uses simple text links, which do not visually convey the typical appearance of "buttons".

    Therefore, while the functionality and placement are largely correct, the visual implementation of "prominent" and "buttons" falls short of what a "highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer" would expect for these terms. The change is present, but its visual quality and emphasis are weak relative to the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied (The instruction was not fully and clearly implemented regarding the visual prominence and form of the 'buttons'.)
