Here's my review based on the provided images:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requested that the "previous and next article links at the very bottom of the post" be made "more visually distinct by making their text bolder and slightly larger."
    The relevant links are identified as:
    *   "This is Revolution!"
    *   "How to keep that A/C cool and running in the hot summer months"

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Boldness:** Yes, the text for both "This is Revolution!" and "How to keep that A/C cool and running in the hot summer months" is visibly bolder in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. This part of the instruction is clearly implemented.
    *   **Size:** Upon close visual inspection, comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font size of these links appears to be exactly the same. There is no discernible increase in size that would qualify as "slightly larger." The only visual change is the increased font weight (boldness).

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a doubt regarding the "slightly larger" aspect of the instruction. While the text was clearly made bolder, the increase in font size is either non-existent or so minuscule that it is not visually perceptible as "slightly larger." The instruction had two distinct visual requirements: bolder *and* slightly larger. Only one of these appears to have been clearly implemented.

**Final verdict:**
