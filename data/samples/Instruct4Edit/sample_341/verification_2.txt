Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for an increase in the vertical spacing (line height or leading) between lines of text within the main article paragraphs. The goal is to make the text "easier to read," implying a more open and less dense appearance for multi-line text blocks.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the multi-line paragraphs (e.g., "During the warmer months, the average humidity should be between 30 and 45 percent...", "Removing unwanted moisture in your home is one of the primary functions...") in the "after" image have noticeably more space between their lines of text compared to the "before" image. The text blocks appear less cramped and more open, which directly addresses the "easier to read" objective.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities.
*   The change is consistently applied to all the multi-line paragraphs that constitute the main content of the article.
*   Single-line text elements (like "Chicago Air Conditioning Repair Near Me." or "To manage health effects and illnesses...") do not show a change in line spacing, which is appropriate as line spacing applies to the vertical distance *between* lines *within* a text block, not between distinct blocks or on single lines.
*   The instruction's scope ("within the main article paragraphs") has been correctly interpreted and applied to the relevant content.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
