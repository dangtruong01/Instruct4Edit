Here's my detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for two changes to the large image located in the footer section:
    a. Reduce its width.
    b. Ensure it is perfectly centered below the article content.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Width Reduction:** Yes, in the "after" image, the large image in the footer is visibly narrower than in the "before" image. Its horizontal span has been significantly reduced.
*   **Centering:** In the "before" image, the footer image appears left-aligned with the main content block. In the "after" image, the image is clearly horizontally centered within the same content block. The text "TUBUDAY - WALK-IN BATHTUBS, SHOWERS & STAIRLIFTS" below the image also appears centered and aligned with the image, reinforcing the centering.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, both parts of the instruction – reducing the width and ensuring perfect centering – are clearly and unambiguously implemented in the "after" image when compared to the "before" image.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
