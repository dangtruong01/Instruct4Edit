Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to change the borders around all text input boxes and the comment area to a much lighter, softer grey color. This implies a noticeable reduction in the darkness and perceived harshness of the existing borders.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the borders around all text input boxes ("Name", "Email", "Last Name", "Email 2") and the comment areas (the top "Sign up today..." box and the two larger boxes at the bottom) appear to be visually identical in color and softness. There is no discernible difference that would indicate they have been made "much lighter" or "softer" in the "after" image. The grey color of the borders remains unchanged from the "before" to the "after" state.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There is no doubt. The intended visual change is not present. The borders' color and softness remain precisely the same in both images.

**Final verdict:**
