Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The intended visual change is to increase the vertical white space between distinct groups of input fields within the form. For example, to add more space between the "Name" input field and the "Email" input field, or between the "Email 2" input field and the "Preferred format" radio buttons. This would visually separate these logical sections, making the form appear less cluttered and potentially easier to read.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible difference in the vertical spacing between any of the input field groups. All vertical gaps appear to be identical in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the absence of the instructed change. The images are visually identical in terms of the vertical spacing between form elements. The instruction to "add more vertical space" has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
