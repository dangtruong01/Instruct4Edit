Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to visually mark fields that are considered "required" by placing a small star (specifically an asterisk in the "after" image) next to their corresponding labels, ensuring this star is clearly visible.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, for certain fields, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, a small orange asterisk has been added next to the "Name" label and the "Email" label. These asterisks were not present in the "before" image. They are distinct, clearly visible, and positioned immediately next to their respective labels.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are doubts regarding the *completeness* of the implementation. The instruction states, "Ensure the small star indicating *required fields* is visible next to its label."
    *   In the "after" image, only "Name" and "Email" are visually indicated as required fields by the presence of a star.
    *   However, other input fields like "Last Name" and "Email 2" do not have this star indicator.
    *   The instruction does not provide a definitive list of *which* specific fields are considered "required". Without knowing the comprehensive set of fields that are designated as "required", it is impossible to confirm if the instruction was fully and completely applied to *all* intended required fields. If "Last Name" or "Email 2" (or any other field) were also intended to be required, then the implementation is incomplete.
    *   As a cautious reviewer, I cannot fully confirm the application without this scope clarity, as the absence of stars on other common input fields suggests a potential partial implementation if those fields are indeed required.
