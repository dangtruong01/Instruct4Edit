Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main heading text ("Sent Straight to Your Inbox!") at the top of the page both larger in size and heavier in font weight (bolder).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes.
    *   **Larger:** In the "after" image, the main heading "Sent Straight to Your Inbox!" has clearly increased in size. This is evident because the text now wraps onto two lines ("Sent Straight to Your" and "Inbox!"), whereas it was on a single line in the "before" image. This visual change signifies a "significantly larger" font size.
    *   **Bolder:** The font weight of the main heading in the "after" image is also visibly heavier (bolder) compared to the "before" image, though this change is more subtle than the size increase.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. Both aspects of the instruction ("significantly larger" and "bolder") have been clearly and unambiguously applied to the main heading.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
