Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**Instruction:** Add more space between the main navigation links at the top of the page, and clearly highlight the link for the page currently being viewed.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Increase the vertical spacing between navigation items like "Welcome," "News," "Schedule," etc.
    *   Apply a distinct visual style to one of the navigation links (e.g., "News") to indicate it is the current page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Space between links:** No. The vertical spacing between the main navigation links (Welcome, News, Schedule, etc.) appears identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no observable increase in space.
    *   **Highlighting current page:** Yes. In the "after" image, the "News" link is visibly different from the other links. It is bold, black, and no longer underlined, whereas the other links remain blue and underlined. This clearly highlights it.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Space between links:** The instruction to "add more space" was not implemented at all. The links are still tightly packed vertically.
    *   **Highlighting current page:** The highlighting for the "News" link is clear and distinct. While the instruction is open to interpretation regarding *how* to highlight, the chosen method (bold, black, non-underlined text) does successfully differentiate it from the other links.
