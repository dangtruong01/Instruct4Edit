Here's my review based on your instructions:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction specifies replacing the existing solid green background in the main banner area with a dynamic image relevant to softball. This means the green color should be gone, and an image should be in its place, visually representing softball.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No. Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, the main banner area at the top of the page remains a solid green background. There is no visible image in this area in the "after" image.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instructed change (replacing the green background with an image) has not been implemented at all. The background remains identical to the "before" state.

**Final verdict:**
