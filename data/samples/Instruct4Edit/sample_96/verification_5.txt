Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended for social media icons located in the footer to be changed to more modern, colorful versions that specifically use their respective brand colors. This implies a replacement of existing icons.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, there are no social media icons present in the footer section. In the "after" image, three distinct social media icons (Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter/X) have been added to the footer, next to the address information. These added icons are modern in appearance, colorful, and correctly utilize their respective brand colors (blue for Facebook and Twitter/X, red for YouTube).

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The primary point of ambiguity lies in the instruction's verb "Update". "Update" typically implies modifying pre-existing elements. However, upon reviewing the "before" image, there were no social media icons in the footer to be updated. The change in the "after" image is, therefore, an *addition* of new social media icons rather than an "update" of existing ones. Despite this, the visual characteristics requested for the icons (modern, colorful, matching brand colors) have been fully and clearly applied to the newly introduced icons. There are no other social media icons in the footer that were left untouched or in an older style.

**Final verdict:** âœ… Fully Applied
