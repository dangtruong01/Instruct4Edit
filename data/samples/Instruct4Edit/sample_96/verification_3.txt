Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims for two distinct visual changes for the news article titles:
    *   **Increased prominence:** Making the titles stand out more from the surrounding text (e.g., through size, weight, or color).
    *   **Link indication:** Visually communicating that these titles are clickable elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Prominence:** In the "after" image, the news article titles ("VWSWA Joins Facebook!", "Softball Canada Cancels 2020 Canadian Championships", "Extension For No Softball Activities - June 1, 2020.") are clearly larger in font size and appear to be bolded compared to their appearance in the "before" image. This significantly increases their prominence.
    *   **Link indication:** In the "after" image, the same news article titles are now colored blue and are underlined. Both blue text and underlining are conventional and widely recognized visual cues for hyperlinks on the web.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. The changes are consistently applied to all news article titles, and the chosen visual treatments (increased size, bolding, blue color, and underline) effectively address both parts of the instruction in a clear and standard manner.
