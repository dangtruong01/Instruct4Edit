Here's the visual UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reduce the vertical space occupied by the "Archives" list in the sidebar. This was suggested to be achieved by making it expandable or scrollable.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the "Archives" section presents a very long, vertically extended list of dates, consuming significant page space. In the "after" image, this entire list has been replaced by a single line showing "▶ Archives". This drastically reduces the vertical space taken by the archives. The "▶" icon visually suggests an expandable (collapsed) element, aligning with the "perhaps by making it expandable" suggestion.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    From a purely visual perspective, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The long list is gone, and a compact, expandable-looking element is in its place. The primary goal of condensing vertical space is explicitly achieved, and the suggested method of an "expandable" element is visually represented by the collapsed state.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
