Here's the analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Change the color of the "Download" button to a shade of green.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Both images show the button as white, and there is no change in color in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the "Download" button in the "after" image has not been changed to green.

Final verdict:
