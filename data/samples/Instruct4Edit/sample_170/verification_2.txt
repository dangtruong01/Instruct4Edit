Here's my assessment:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the space between the "main heading" and the "social media icons". The main heading is presumably the large title at the top, and the social media icons seem to be the small icons in the center of the image.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The change is barely noticeable, if at all.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There is no clear or significant increase in space.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
