**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies two changes for the main page heading, "David Trott":
    *   Increase its font size.
    *   Make it appear bolder.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size:** Comparing the "David Trott" heading in the "before" image to the "after" image, the text in the "after" image is noticeably larger in height and width, indicating an increased font size.
    *   **Bolder appearance:** The stroke weight of the characters in "David Trott" in the "after" image is clearly thicker and more pronounced than in the "before" image, making it appear distinctly bolder.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Both requested changes (increased font size and bolder appearance) are clearly and fully implemented for the specified heading "David Trott." There are no ambiguities or missing elements in the application of this instruction.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
