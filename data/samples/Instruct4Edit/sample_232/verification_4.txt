As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images against the provided instruction.

**Instruction:** Add more vertical space above and below the large images and the main text blocks within the content area to improve readability.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing (margins or padding) around two types of elements:
    *   "Large images" (implying all images of significant size within the content).
    *   "Main text blocks" (referring to the primary paragraphs or sections of text).
    The goal is to provide more "breathing room" to enhance readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Large Images:**
        *   **Bottom Landscape Image:** Yes, there is a clear and noticeable increase in vertical space both *above* and *below* this large image in the "after" image. This part of the instruction has been clearly applied.
        *   **Portrait Image (of David Trott):** No. There is no visible increase in vertical space either *above* or *below* this portrait image. Its vertical alignment and the way the surrounding text flows around it remain virtually identical to the "before" image. Given its size and prominence on the page, a cautious reviewer would consider this a "large image" within the context of the page's content, and thus, the instruction was not applied to it.

    *   **Main Text Blocks:**
        *   **Space below the "David Trott" heading and above the first paragraph ("Als Kommunikationselektroniker..."):** There appears to be a very slight, almost imperceptible, increase in vertical space here. It is not significant enough to be considered a clear application of "more vertical space" for a "main text block" boundary.
        *   **Space between the first text block and the "Davids Abschlussprojekt" heading:** There is no visible increase in vertical space here. The elements remain tightly spaced.
        *   **Space below the "Davids Abschlussprojekt" heading and above the second paragraph ("Während der Crossmedia-Ausbildung..."):** There is no visible increase in vertical space here.
        *   **Space below the second text block ("Während der Crossmedia-Ausbildung...") and above the bottom large image:** Yes, there is a clear and significant increase in vertical space here. This part of the instruction has been clearly applied.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements and inconsistencies:
    *   **Missing space around the portrait image:** This is a clear omission. The instruction uses the plural "large images," and the portrait image is a visually substantial element that did not receive the specified vertical spacing.
    *   **Inconsistent spacing for text blocks:** While some text block boundaries received more space (e.g., the final text block before the large image), others did not (e.g., between the first text block and the second heading, or between the second heading and the second text block). This indicates a partial, rather than full and clear, implementation of spacing for "main text blocks."

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
