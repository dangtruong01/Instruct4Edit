Here's my review based on the provided images:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modify a "prominent blue button in the main content area" by:
    *   Changing its color to a darker shade of blue.
    *   Making its corners perfectly square instead of rounded.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Upon careful inspection of both the "before" and "after" images, no "prominent blue button" is present in the main content area (or anywhere else on the page). The images provided are visually identical.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental missing element: the target "prominent blue button" described in the instruction. Since the button itself is not present in either image, it's impossible to verify if its color or corner radius has been altered. Both images are exactly the same, indicating no design change was applied to them.

**Final verdict:**
