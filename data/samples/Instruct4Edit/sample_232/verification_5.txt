**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to change the background color of the bottom-most bar of the page (which contains the copyright notice and links like "Datenschutz" and "Impressum") to a deep charcoal or nearly black color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon close comparison, the background color of the bottom-most bar in the "before" image is a light grey. In the "after" image, the background color of the same bar remains the identical light grey. There is no discernible change in color to a deep charcoal or nearly black.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instructed visual change was not applied; the element's background color remains unchanged.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
