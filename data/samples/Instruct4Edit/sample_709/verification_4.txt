Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires to make the selected tab in the "Plant Info," "Care," "Common Problems" section more visually prominent. This could be achieved by changing its background color, font weight, or adding an underline.
2. In the 'after' image, the 'Plant Info' tab is slightly more prominent than the other tabs, likely achieved by increasing the font weight to bold or something close. This is a very subtle change.
3. While there is a change, it is so subtle that it might not be immediately apparent to the user. A stronger visual cue, such as a background color change or a more noticeable underline, would have been more effective.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied (but barely)
