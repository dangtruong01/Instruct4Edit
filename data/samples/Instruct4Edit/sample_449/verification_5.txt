Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a divider line between the breadcrumbs (Home > Morphosmart) and the main content area (the area containing "6896Morphosmart").
2. By visually comparing the two images, it's evident that no divider line has been added between the breadcrumbs and the main content area.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction. The change is clearly not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
