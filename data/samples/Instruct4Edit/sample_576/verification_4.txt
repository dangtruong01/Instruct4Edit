Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow effect to the main header. The main header is assumed to be the very top part of the page, containing "JOKY PARK", "CENTRO INVERNALE", "PROMO & NEWS" and "CONTATTI".
2. Comparing the before and after images, it is not possible to observe any shadow effect added to the header.
3. There is no visible change to the header.

Final verdict:
