1. The instruction asks to add a thin border to the images on the right sidebar.
2. The right sidebar appears to be empty in both images. Therefore, the instruction cannot be applied.
3. There are no images to apply the border to on the right sidebar, making the instruction impossible to follow.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
