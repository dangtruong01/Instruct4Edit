Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The navigation bar at the top should change to a solid, slightly transparent, darker color. This implies a color change with a degree of opacity, making the background behind the navigation bar partially visible.

2.  **Visibility of the change:** The "After" image shows the navigation bar with a background color that is darker than the original. The navigation bar appears to be a solid color, but it does not appear to be slightly transparent, or show any background.

3.  **Doubts and Ambiguities:** While the color is darker, the opacity is not clearly visible.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
