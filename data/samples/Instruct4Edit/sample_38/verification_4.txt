Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The background color of the footer should change to a different shade of gray.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the footer's background color has visibly changed to a lighter shade of gray.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
