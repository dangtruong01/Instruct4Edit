Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests changes to the navigation links at the top of the page to make them more prominent and modern. This includes potentially changing the font, increasing the size, and adding spacing.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there are no visual changes to the navigation links. The font, size, and spacing of the navigation links remain the same.
3. There are no visible changes in the after image to indicate that the instruction was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
