Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires a subtle shadow effect to be added to the fieldsets. This is intended to make them appear slightly elevated from the background, providing visual depth.
2. By comparing the two images, I cannot see any noticeable difference in terms of shadow effect or any other visual change applied to the fieldsets.
3. There is no visual cue indicating that a shadow has been added.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
