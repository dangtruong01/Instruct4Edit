Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the main heading and the fieldset below it. The main heading appears to be "NV08C-RTK-M @ 2*OBS421 (IP66 FL/WR PC/BK Box, 7 Ah LiPo) : 1800 EUR *". The fieldset is the black box with the text starting with "Beispielfotos: [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]".

3. There is no ambiguity and the change is clearly visible.
