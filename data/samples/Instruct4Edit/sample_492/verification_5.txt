Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the footer links more visually prominent by changing their color.
2. Comparing the two images, the color of the footer links ("Home") has not been changed. They remain the same dark gray color.
3. The change is not visible; therefore, the instruction has not been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
