Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow effect to the main heading of the page to make it stand out. The main heading is "Descarga de la versión más reciente de citra".
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any shadow effect applied to the main heading in the second image compared to the first image.
3. There is no visible change.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
