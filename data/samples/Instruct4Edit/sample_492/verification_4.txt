Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the main content area and the footer. This implies increasing the vertical space/padding between the last element of the main content and the first element of the footer.
2. Comparing the two images, it appears that the space between the end of the "New Posts" section (part of the main content) and the "Home" link (part of the footer) has been increased.
3. There are no immediately apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The change is visible and appears to implement the instruction.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
