❌ Not Applied

Justification:
1. The instruction was to make the search bar bigger and give it rounded corners. The search bar is assumed to be located at the top right of the page, based on common UI patterns.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible change to a search bar in the top right corner or anywhere else. The page layout is identical.
3. Since there is no visible change in the size or corners of any element resembling a search bar, the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
