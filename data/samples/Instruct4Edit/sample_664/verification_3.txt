As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, here's my assessment:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to create a visible separation (a small gap) between two specific elements at the bottom of the UI: the "comments count" and the "share icon."

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, this change is not visible.
In both the "before" and "after" images, only the "comments count" (represented by the number "0" at the bottom right corner) is present. A "share icon" is entirely absent from both images. Therefore, there are no two elements to separate, making it impossible to observe the intended change.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there is a critical missing element: the "share icon." The instruction implies the existence or addition of both the comments count and the share icon for the separation to occur. Since the share icon is not present in either the original or modified image, the instruction cannot be fully implemented or verified as described. The UI visually remains identical at the specified location in both images.

**Final verdict:**
