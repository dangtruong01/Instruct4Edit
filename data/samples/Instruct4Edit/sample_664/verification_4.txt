Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requires a "share icon" to be added and made visible next to the "comments count" at the bottom right corner of the content box.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** In the "before" image, there is a "0" (presumably the comments count) at the very bottom right. In the "after" image, the exact same "0" is present in the exact same location, with no share icon visible next to it. Both images appear identical in this specific area.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the share icon is completely missing from the "after" image. The instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
