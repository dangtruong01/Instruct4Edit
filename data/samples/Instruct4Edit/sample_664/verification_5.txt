**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two changes to a "share options dialog":
    *   Give it a slightly lighter background color than the current dark overlay.
    *   Gently round its corners for a softer look.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Neither the "before" image nor the "after" image displays a "share options dialog" or any form of overlay/dialog. Both images are identical and show only the main content (an image of feet with socks and boots, and accompanying German text). Therefore, it is impossible to verify if the specified changes were applied to the non-existent dialog.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the crucial element that is supposed to be modified – the "share options dialog" – is completely absent from both the provided "before" and "after" images. Without the presence of the dialog, it's impossible to assess whether its background color was lightened or if its corners were rounded.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied (or rather, unable to verify as the element is missing)
