Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the background color of the navigation bar, located at the very top of the page (containing "Open in app", "Sign up", and "Sign in"), to a light gray. This change is intended to create a visual distinction between the navigation bar and the main content of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Both the "before" and "after" images show the navigation bar area with a white background. There is no discernible shift to a light gray color in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities; the instructed color change is entirely absent. The "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image in the area where the change was supposed to occur.

**Final verdict:**
