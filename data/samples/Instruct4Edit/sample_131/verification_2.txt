Here's my review based on a highly cautious visual comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to modify the prominent green "Sign up" and "Follow" buttons. Specifically, their corners were to become "slightly less rounded," transitioning them towards a "rectangular shape with soft corners" from their current, more highly rounded appearance.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible.
    *   **"Sign up" button:** When comparing the "Sign up" button in the top right corner of the "before" image to the "after" image, its corner radius appears to be exactly the same. There is no discernible reduction in its rounding.
    *   **"Follow" buttons:** Similarly, all the green "Follow" buttons within the follower list maintain the exact same degree of rounding in the "after" image as they displayed in the "before" image. They retain their highly rounded, almost pill-like shape, and show no visual indication of being "slightly less rounded" or more rectangular.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction clearly specifies a visual alteration to the button's shape (less rounded, more rectangular with soft corners). Upon careful side-by-side comparison, no such visual change has occurred in any of the specified buttons. Both images appear identical in terms of the button shapes.

**Final verdict:**
