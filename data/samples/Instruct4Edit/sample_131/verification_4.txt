Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intended to increase the vertical space between each individual follower entry in the main list to make them appear less cramped. This means the gaps between "A&M Space" and "Maple Wellington," "Maple Wellington" and "CJ Amberwood," etc., should be visibly larger in the "after" image.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close inspection and direct comparison of both images, the vertical spacing between all follower entries remains exactly the same. There is no discernible increase in the vertical gaps between them.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts. The instruction was to "add more vertical space," implying an increase in existing space. Visually, no such increase has occurred. The layout of the follower list is identical in both images.

**Final verdict:**
