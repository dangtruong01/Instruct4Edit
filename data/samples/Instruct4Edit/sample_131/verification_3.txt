Here's the visual UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to "increase the maximum width of the main content area where the followers are listed." This implies that the central column containing the follower profiles (avatars, names, descriptions, and follow buttons) should expand horizontally, making the content area wider. The goal is to "allow more space for the follower names and descriptions," which might result in longer text fitting on a single line or having more room before wrapping.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon a direct comparison of the two images, there is no discernible visual change in the width of the main content area.
    *   The "Postcards from a Distant Land" and "Followers" navigation tabs, the "12 Followers" heading, and the entire list of individual followers occupy precisely the same horizontal space in both the "before" and "after" images.
    *   The horizontal position and alignment of the follower avatars and names on the left, and the "Follow" buttons on the right, remain identical.
    *   Crucially, the multi-line description for "CJ Amberwood" wraps at the exact same point and occupies the exact same horizontal space in both images. If the width had increased, this text might have spread out more horizontally or taken up fewer lines.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts. The instruction to *increase* the width has not been visually implemented. The "after" image appears to be pixel-perfect identical to the "before" image in terms of the content area's dimensions and layout. No increase in horizontal space for names or descriptions is evident.

**Final verdict:**
