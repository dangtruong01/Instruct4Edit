As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the two images provided.

**Instruction:** Apply a very thin, subtle outline to all the circular profile pictures to make them stand out slightly more.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction clearly specifies adding a "very thin, subtle outline" to all circular profile pictures. The purpose is to make these elements "stand out slightly more."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    I have carefully examined every circular profile picture (the small grey circles next to each name) in both the "before" and "after" images. Upon close inspection, there is no discernable difference between the two images regarding these elements. No outline, thin or otherwise, subtle or prominent, appears to have been added to any of the circular profile pictures in the "after" image. They remain identical in appearance to their "before" counterparts.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instructed change – the addition of an outline – is completely missing from all specified elements in the "after" image. The two images appear to be visually identical in the areas relevant to the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
