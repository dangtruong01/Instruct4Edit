Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to change the background of the main header (the dark strip containing "Zasadnutie Rady SPF sa uskutoční" and "09.11.2022") to a "consistent, very light semi-transparent color." The aim is for it to be distinct and visible, implying a change from its current solid, dark state.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. The main header background in the "after" image appears to be identical to the "before" image. It remains a solid, dark color, showing no signs of being "very light" or "semi-transparent."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The "after" image shows no alteration to the main header's background color or opacity. The background is still dark and opaque, which directly contradicts the instruction to make it "very light semi-transparent."

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
