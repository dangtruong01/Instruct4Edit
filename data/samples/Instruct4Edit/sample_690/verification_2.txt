Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to establish a unified visual style for all interactive buttons and navigation links. This unified style should specifically involve using the site's primary dark brown color as a solid background for these elements. The goal is to make all such elements visually consistent and cohesive.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, a significant part of this change is clearly visible.
- In the "before" image, the "Na hlavnú stránku" and "Ďalší článok" buttons had a white background with a dark border and text. In the "after" image, these buttons now feature a solid dark brown background with white text, aligning with the instruction.
- Crucially, the text links in the footer section (e.g., "O nás", "Dôležité linky", "Kontakty", etc.), which were plain text in the "before" image, have been transformed into distinct rectangular buttons with the same solid dark brown background and white text, creating a unified look with the primary call-to-action buttons.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements concerning the complete application of the instruction, especially for "navigation links":
- The instruction specifies "all interactive buttons... AND the navigation links". While the primary buttons and the footer navigation elements have been styled consistently, other interactive elements that function as "navigation links" have been overlooked.
- Specifically, the in-text hyperlinks such as "28. októbra 2022", "Oznámenie" (under the main heading), "stredu 9. novembra 2022", and "Zmluvy na prerokovanie v Rade SPF" (within the body text) remain as default blue/purple underlined text links in the "after" image. These are undeniably interactive links that serve a navigational purpose.
- For the instruction to be "fully and clearly implemented" and for "all interactive buttons... AND the navigation links" to "share a unified visual style" using the dark brown background, these in-text links should also have adopted the new style or at least a style consistent with the new button aesthetic. Their current appearance breaks the intended visual unity.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
