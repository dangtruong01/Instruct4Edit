Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make images within the article content appear less as isolated blocks and more as integrated elements. This involves two key aspects:
    *   **Text Wrapping:** The text should flow around the images (e.g., on the sides) rather than just starting above and continuing below them.
    *   **Breathing Room:** Sufficient space (padding/margin) should be added between the images and the surrounding text to prevent a cramped appearance and improve readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image Analysis:**
        *   The "COGAM" logo at the top left of the article: The text next to it starts on its right, but then flows *below* the image. There is no actual wrapping around the image's vertical extent.
        *   The "Ayuda a quien lo necesita" image further down: This image is also on the left, and the text above it stops, the image is placed, and then the text resumes *below* it. There is no text wrapping at all, and the image feels very close to the text surrounding it.
    *   **After Image Analysis:**
        *   **COGAM Logo:** The text now clearly wraps around the "COGAM" logo. The paragraph next to it extends downwards along the right side of the image. There is also visible breathing room between the image and the text.
        *   **"Ayuda a quien lo necesita" Image:** This image has been moved from the left to the *right* side of the article content. Crucially, the text now wraps cleanly around its left side, flowing smoothly alongside it. Ample visual breathing room has been added between the image and the text.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the changes are very clear and directly address all aspects of the instruction. Both images within the main content have been modified to include text wrapping and improved spacing, leading to significantly better integration.
