Here's the comparison and verification:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to change the background color of the primary navigation menu (identified as the top header strip containing the "LIT CON MADRID" logo and the four circular placeholders) to a lighter shade. This change aims to make it blend more harmoniously with the rest of the page's design.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the background of the top header/navigation area is a distinct dark purple/lilac color. In the "after" image, this area's background has been changed to a very light, almost white, pale lavender shade. The contrast between the old and new background color is significant and immediately noticeable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The specific area identified as the "primary navigation menu" (the top header bar) has had its background color changed precisely as instructed. The new color is unambiguously lighter and visually integrates better with the predominantly light design of the page.
