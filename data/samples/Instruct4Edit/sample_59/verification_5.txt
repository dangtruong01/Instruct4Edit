Here's my cautious visual UI/UX review:

**Instruction:** Refine the appearance of the 'Newer Post' and 'Older Post' navigation buttons at the bottom of the article, making them appear softer and more integrated with the page style, perhaps with rounded corners or a less prominent border.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the 'Newer Post' (ENTRADA MÁS RECIENTE) and 'Older Post' (ENTRADA ANTIGUA) buttons at the bottom of the article visually "softer" and "more integrated" with the overall page style. It offers two specific design suggestions to achieve this: "perhaps with rounded corners" or "a less prominent border."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The buttons are rectangular with sharp 90-degree corners and a distinct black border.
    *   **After Image:** The buttons now clearly feature **rounded corners**. This change is immediately noticeable and directly implements one of the suggested methods. The rounded corners undeniably contribute to a "softer" appearance. Furthermore, looking at other elements on the page (e.g., the "Lit Con Madrid" header logo has subtle rounding, and the right sidebar's "OTRAS 'CON'" and "CONTACTANOS" sections have rounded corners), introducing rounded corners to these buttons makes them appear more "integrated" with the overall design language.
    *   Regarding the "less prominent border" suggestion, the border around the buttons remains a black line of what appears to be the same thickness and prominence as in the "before" image. This specific part of the suggestion was **not** implemented.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    While the "rounded corners" suggestion was clearly and effectively implemented, the "less prominent border" aspect was not. However, the instruction used the phrasing "perhaps with rounded corners *or* a less prominent border." The use of "or" implies that achieving the desired "softer and more integrated" look could be done by either method, or potentially a combination. Since the core objective (softer, more integrated appearance) was effectively achieved through the application of rounded corners, and this was one of the explicitly provided options, the instruction can be considered fulfilled in its intent. The "perhaps" also indicates that these were suggestions, not strict requirements if the primary goal could be met otherwise.
