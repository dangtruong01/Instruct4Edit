As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the two images provided.

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction requested an enhancement to the "Show" links for "Classification" and "Parent Term(s)". This enhancement was intended to make them more visually intuitive for expandable content, potentially by adding an arrow icon or transforming them into a small button.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon a detailed pixel-by-pixel comparison of the "before" and "after" images, no visual changes are visible for the "Show" links associated with "Classification" and "Parent Term(s)". Both instances of the "Show" link remain plain, underlined text, identical in appearance in both images. There are no added icons, no button styling, or any other visual cues indicating expandable content as suggested by the instruction. In fact, the two images appear to be identical in every aspect.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the implementation. The instructed change is entirely missing. The "Show" links were not enhanced in any way that makes them more visually intuitive or indicates expandable content through an icon or button.

**Final verdict:**
