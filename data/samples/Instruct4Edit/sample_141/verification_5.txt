Here's the detailed comparison:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction requested two main visual changes for pop-up windows:
    *   **Close Buttons:** Give them a clearer, more modern look (e.g., simple 'X' icon or a button with a border).
    *   **Text Content Spacing:** Ensure the text content inside these windows is well-spaced for better readability.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Close Buttons:** Yes, this change is clearly visible.
        *   For the large pop-up ("A Note on Ongoing Revisions..."), the 'x' icon has been redesigned to be larger, bolder, and enclosed within a more defined button area, making it significantly clearer and more modern.
        *   For the two smaller pop-ups ("Message" and "Graph"), the "Close" text buttons now have a visible border and a subtle background color, transforming them into clearly defined buttons, aligning with the "button with a border" part of the instruction.
    *   **Text Content Spacing:** No, this change is **not** visible.
        *   Upon close inspection of the text content within the large pop-up window, specifically the bulleted lists (e.g., under "February 2017 Changes," "April 2017 Changes," etc.), the line spacing, paragraph spacing, and spacing between list items appear identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible improvement in text spacing for better readability.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
*   The implementation of the close button redesign is clear and effective.
*   However, the second part of the instruction, regarding "well-spaced for better readability" of text content inside the pop-up windows, has not been visually applied. The text layout and spacing remain unchanged from the original design.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
