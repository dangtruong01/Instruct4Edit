Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the navigation bar to visually separate it from the content below. I need to visually check for the presence of a shadow effect.
2. Examining the two images, I can't see any distinct shadow behind the navigation bar in the second image compared to the first. The navigation bar looks identical in both.
3. There is no discernible shadow effect applied in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
