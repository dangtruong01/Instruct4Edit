Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires adding a subtle shadow effect to the user profile image in the sidebar. The user profile image is the small circular image in the top right corner of the screen.
2. Comparing the before and after images, it is difficult to see any shadow effect applied to the user profile image in the top right corner. The difference between the images is very small.
3. Given the subtle nature of the requested change, and the lack of a clear shadow effect, it's difficult to say with certainty if the instruction has been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
