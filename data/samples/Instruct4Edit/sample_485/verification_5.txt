Step-by-step justification:
1. The intention is to change the green color of all "Follow" buttons to a more noticeable shade of green.
2. Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, I see no noticeable difference in the shade of green used for the "Follow" buttons.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction itself, but the change is not visually apparent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
