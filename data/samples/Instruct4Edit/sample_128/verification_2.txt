Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the search input field and its accompanying button visually stand out more in the navigation area. Specifically, it suggests applying softer, rounded edges to these elements and ensuring the search button remains clearly visible.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The search input field is a simple rectangular white box with sharp corners, blending into the background. The search button is a green rectangle with sharp corners.
    *   **After Image:**
        *   **Search Input Field:** The input field now has a subtle light gray border around it, making it visually distinct from the white background. Crucially, its corners have been softened and are now noticeably rounded.
        *   **Search Button:** The green search button also exhibits softer, rounded edges, matching the new styling of the input field. Its green color ensures it remains clearly visible, as it was before, and the rounding adds to its visual distinctness as part of the search component.

    The changes are subtle but clearly visible upon close inspection, particularly the rounding of the corners on both elements and the added border on the input field. This collectively makes the search component more "visually distinct" and aligns with the "softer, rounded edges" suggestion.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities.
    *   "Visually distinct": Achieved by the added border to the input field and the rounding of both elements, making them a more cohesive and noticeable unit.
    *   "perhaps with softer, rounded edges": This suggestion was clearly implemented for both the input field and the button. The edges are visibly less sharp and more rounded.
    *   "ensure the search button is clearly visible": The button was already a bright green and visible. Its visibility has been maintained and arguably enhanced by being part of a more distinct search component.
