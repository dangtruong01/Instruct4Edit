Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the sidebar boxes (the green elements containing "Surface Pro 4", "Surface Pro 2017", etc.) appear softer. This involves two specific actions:
    *   Removing the visible, strong outlines (borders) around these boxes.
    *   Increasing the internal space (padding) between the text content and the edges of these boxes.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Removing strong outlines:** In the "before" image, each green box clearly has a dark grey/black outline. In the "after" image, these outlines are completely gone. The green boxes now appear as solid, borderless rectangles. This change is very clear.
    *   **Adding more internal padding around the text:** In the "before" image, the text ("Surface Pro 4", etc.) is quite close to the top and bottom edges of the green box. In the "after" image, there is significantly more vertical space above and below the text, making it appear more centered and less cramped within the box. This indicates increased internal padding. The horizontal padding also appears slightly increased, contributing to the "softer" look.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction mentioned "text and images" for padding. The specific sidebar boxes being modified (the green ones) only contain text, not images. Therefore, the "images" part of the padding instruction is not applicable to these elements, but the "text" part has been clearly addressed. There are no images *within* these specific boxes to apply padding to, so this is not a missing element of the implementation but rather a reflection of the content of the boxes. All applicable parts of the instruction have been visually implemented.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
