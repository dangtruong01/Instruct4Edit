As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the two images provided, focusing on the instructed changes.

**Instruction:** Update the main navigation bar to use a lighter background color, and add more space between the individual menu items.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies two changes to "the main navigation bar":
    *   Change its background color to a lighter shade.
    *   Increase the spacing between the individual menu items within that bar.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparison, there are two navigation-like bars on the page: one at the very top (above the main banner) and one at the very bottom (footer-like).

    *   **Focusing on the top navigation bar:**
        *   **Lighter background color:** In the "before" image, the top bar is extremely dark, almost black, making the "HOME", "Surface Pro 4", etc. text virtually invisible due to poor contrast. In the "after" image, this bar's background has clearly changed to a light gray color. This is a significant and clear change to a lighter background.
        *   **More space between individual menu items:** In the "before" image, due to the extreme darkness, it's impossible to discern individual menu items or their spacing. However, in the "after" image, the menu items ("HOME", "Surface Pro 4", "Surface Pro 2017", "Surface Book", "Surface Laptop", "Surface Go") are now clearly visible and have distinct horizontal spacing between them. This indicates that spacing has been added or increased, fulfilling the second part of the instruction.

    *   **Focusing on the bottom navigation bar:**
        *   The background color of the bottom bar remains dark green in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no change to a lighter color.
        *   The spacing between menu items in the bottom bar also appears to be unchanged.

    Given that "the main navigation bar" usually refers to the primary navigation on a site, and only the top bar exhibits *both* instructed changes, it is reasonable to conclude that the top bar was the intended target. The changes made to the top bar are highly visible and directly address both parts of the instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The only potential ambiguity is which specific navigation bar is "the main navigation bar." However, since only the top navigation bar demonstrates *both* of the required changes (lighter background and increased spacing), while the bottom bar shows neither, it strongly implies the top bar was the intended one. The change also transforms the top bar from an unusable, almost invisible element into a clear and functional navigation component, which aligns with the intent of such a design instruction. All aspects of the instruction are visibly present in the modified top navigation bar.
