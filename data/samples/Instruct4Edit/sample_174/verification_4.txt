Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction requests a lighter shade for the site header's background color. The site header appears to be the top portion of the page, containing the site title.
2.  **Visibility of change:** Both images appear to have the exact same white background color for the site header.
3.  **Doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements:**  The background color has not changed. The requested modification is not apparent.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
