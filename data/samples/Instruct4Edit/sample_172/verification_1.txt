Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to darken the text color of the navigation bar.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**  Yes, the navigation bar text is a darker shade in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clear and consistent with the instruction.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
