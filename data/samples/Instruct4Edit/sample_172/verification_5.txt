Step-by-step justification:
1. What is the intended visual change? Add a subtle shadow to the bottom of the navigation bar. The navigation bar, as seen in the images, is the area at the top, which shows the words, "descargar spotify android" and "descargar spotify android."
2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image? No, there is no clearly visible shadow added to the bottom of the navigation bar.
3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements? The change is not apparent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
