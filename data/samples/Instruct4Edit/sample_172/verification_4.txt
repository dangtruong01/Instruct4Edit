Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** Reduce the font size of the links in the sidebar (i.e., "New Posts" section).
2.  **Visibility of Change:** The font size of the links in the "New Posts" section seems *slightly* smaller in the "after" image, compared to the "before" image.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** While a visual change appears to exist, the difference is subtle. It is difficult to be absolutely certain without exact measurements.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
