Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction requires the "View All Posts" button to increase in size and change its color.
2.  **Visibility of changes:** In the second image, the "View All Posts" button is now missing entirely.
3.  **Doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements:** The instruction is not implemented since the button is removed.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
