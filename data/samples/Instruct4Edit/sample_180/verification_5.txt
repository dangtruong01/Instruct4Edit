Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction is to reduce the padding around the "author box" (the area containing "admin" and "View All Posts"). This means the space surrounding the box should be smaller.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the padding around the author box is reduced.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
