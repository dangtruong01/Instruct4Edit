Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow effect to be added to the header area. This should create the illusion of depth, making the header appear to stand out slightly from the rest of the page.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot discern any visible difference in the header area regarding a shadow effect. The header in both images looks identical.
3. There is no apparent shadow effect added to the header area in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
