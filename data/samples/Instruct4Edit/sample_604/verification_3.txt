Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the horizontal spacing between the main content area (the text on the left) and the sidebar on the right (containing the search bar and subscription form).
2. Comparing the two images, the horizontal gap between the text on the left and the search/subscribe box on the right appears identical. There's no visually discernible difference in the spacing.
3. There's no ambiguity in the instruction itself. The spacing is clearly defined, and the comparison should be straightforward. Since there is no visual difference, the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
