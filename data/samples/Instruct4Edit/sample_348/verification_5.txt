Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the comment submission button to have rounded corners and a slightly lighter background color.
2. I cannot locate any comment submission button in either image. Thus, there's nothing to visually confirm regarding changes to its style.
3. There are no interactive elements such as a comment submission form to submit a comment with a submission button, so no changes can be verified.

Final verdict:
