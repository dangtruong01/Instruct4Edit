Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to enlarge the text inside the "Unlock access!" box. This means increasing the font size of the text elements within the box to make them visually more prominent.
2. By comparing the "before" and "after" images, it's clear that the font size of all the text within the "Unlock access!" box ("Unlock access!", "Check out our programs here.", "Already a member? Login now by clicking here.", "See you on the inside!") has been increased. The text appears larger and more noticeable in the "after" image.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible and consistent with the instruction.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
