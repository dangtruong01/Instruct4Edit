Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between navigation links in the header. However, there are no navigation links in the header in either image.
2. Since there are no navigation links present, it's impossible to increase the spacing between them.
3. The instruction is unclear because it refers to something that doesn't exist in the images.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
