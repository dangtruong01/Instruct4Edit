Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Align the main navigation items, like "Katja de Man" and "Schrijver", to the right side of the page header.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to move the list of navigation items ("• Home", "• Life Coach", "Katja de Man", "Schrijver") from their initial position on the top-left of the page header to the top-right side.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, in the "before" image, the navigation items are distinctly aligned to the left of the header. In the "after" image, these same items ("• Home", "• Life Coach", "Katja de Man", "Schrijver") are clearly visible and aligned to the right side of the page header. The change is pronounced and unambiguous.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the instruction was clear, and the visual change in the "after" image fully reflects that instruction. All mentioned items are now on the right side.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
