**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests an increase in the vertical spacing (whitespace, margins, or padding) between distinct sections in the sidebar. Specifically, it mentions the space between the "Categories" list and the "Gedachtenspinsels" description, implying that all similar sectional divisions in the sidebar should have increased separation.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon pixel-by-pixel comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the vertical spacing between the "Categories" section and the "Gedachtenspinsels" section appears identical. Similarly, the spacing between "Gedachtenspinsels" and "Archief," and between "Archief" and "RSS Feed" remains unchanged. There is no discernible increase in the space separating these sidebar sections in the "after" image. The layout of the sidebar content is visually identical in both images with regard to vertical spacing between sections.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction to increase spacing between sidebar sections has not been applied. The visual elements in the sidebar are positioned with the exact same vertical separation in both the "before" and "after" images.

**Final verdict:**
