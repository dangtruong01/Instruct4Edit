Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction specifies changing the background color of the entire footer area to a slightly darker shade, making it visually distinct from the main content. This means the area at the bottom of the page (from "1 Comment" down to "Life Coach") should have a different, darker background color than the main body of the article.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, there is no visible change in the background color of the footer area. In both the "before" and "after" images, the footer area's background is identical to the main content area – a consistent white (or very light off-white). There is no darker shade applied.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is completely missing. The footer area's background color remains unchanged and is not visually distinct from the main content.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
