Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to add more vertical whitespace (empty space) directly above the main blog post title "Je Hart bepaalt je levensgeluk." and directly below it. This change aims to improve the visual separation and readability of the title from its surrounding elements (metadata above, blog content below).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **Above the title:** In the "after" image, the vertical space between the "1 Comment" line and the title "Je Hart bepaalt je levensgeluk." has noticeably increased compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Below the title:** Similarly, the vertical space between the title "Je Hart bepaalt je levensgeluk." and the first paragraph of the blog post ("De stem die het waart...") has also clearly increased in the "after" image.
    The title now has more "breathing room" both above and below it.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the instruction was specific and has been implemented fully and clearly. There are no visual ambiguities or missing elements related to the requested change.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
