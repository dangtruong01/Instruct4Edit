**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a "soft, subtle drop shadow" to the large image within the blog post. The purpose stated is "to make it stand out."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon very close inspection and significant zooming, an extremely faint, diffuse shadow can be discerned along the bottom and right edges of the image in the "after" version. This shadow is absent in the "before" version. However, the shadow is so exceptionally subtle that it is barely visible to the naked eye under normal viewing conditions.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes. While pixels consistent with an *extremely* subtle drop shadow are technically present, its visibility is so minimal that it is not "clearly visible" without deliberate effort (zooming in, pixel-peeping). Consequently, the primary objective of "making it stand out" is not achieved. The shadow's extreme subtlety renders it ineffective in creating any noticeable separation or depth for the image. The implementation is "subtle" to a fault, making it practically invisible and failing its purpose.
