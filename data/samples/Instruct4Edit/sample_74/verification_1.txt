Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the space around the logo, which means adding padding or margins.
2. It is difficult to identify any logo in these images. Considering all the other website elements present in the images, the most likely candidate for being a logo are the brand name and symbol at the bottom of the pages. There is no visible increase in space around these elements in the second image compared to the first image.
3. It is unclear which exact element is considered the logo. If the elements at the bottom of the page were incorrectly identified, the answer to the instruction cannot be verified with certainty.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
