Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to center the social network icons within their container on the right sidebar.
2. Upon comparing the two images, it's evident that there are no visible social network icons in either image. Therefore, no change related to centering them could have been applied.
3. The absence of social network icons suggests that the instruction couldn't be implemented based on the given images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
