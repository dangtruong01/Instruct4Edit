Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to slightly darken the background color behind the main heading. The main heading is "CAREERS IN LUBBOCK – JOIN OUR TEAM!".
2. Comparing the two images, it's extremely difficult to discern any change in the background color behind the main heading. The change, if present, is very subtle.
3. Due to the subtlety of the change (if any), I cannot be certain the instruction was fully implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
