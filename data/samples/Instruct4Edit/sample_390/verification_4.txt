Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation links in the header. The header navigation links are "HOME", "ABOUT", "SERVICES", "LAND SURVEYING", "CIVIL ENGINEERING", "LAND PLANNING", "CAREERS", "CONTACT".
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the navigation links ("HOME", "ABOUT", "SERVICES", "LAND SURVEYING", "CIVIL ENGINEERING", "LAND PLANNING", "CAREERS", "CONTACT") appears to be identical. There is no increase in spacing.
3. There are no ambiguities. The change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
