Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the font in the footer to a simpler, more readable sans-serif font. A sans-serif font is one without the small features called "serifs" at the end of strokes.
2. Visually comparing the two images, the font in the footer appears to have changed from a serif font to a sans-serif font. This is most clearly visible in the letters like "A", "T", and "E".
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
