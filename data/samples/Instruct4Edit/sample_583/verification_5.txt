1. The instruction is to display an image on the right side of the content area, specifically on larger screens, and to avoid overlapping the text.
2. Comparing the two images, the second image (after) shows an image placed on the right side of the text.
3. There is no overlap between the text and image. The instruction mentions it applying on larger screens, but since the image is displayed on the given screen size, we can assume that's what was intended.

Final verdict:
