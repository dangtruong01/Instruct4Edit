Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a more modern look for the signup and login buttons, including a subtle shadow and softer edges.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the signup and login buttons appear to have slightly rounded edges. However, a subtle shadow is not clearly visible.
3. The "softer edges" part of the instruction seems partially applied. The subtle shadow requested is either not visible or not present.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
