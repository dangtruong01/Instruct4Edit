Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requires adding a visual cue (either a subtle background color change or an underline animation) to the main menu items when a user hovers their mouse over them. This is a dynamic interaction, meaning the change should only appear when the mouse is positioned over a menu item.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. Neither image displays any menu item in a "hovered" state (i.e., with a different background color or an underline). The menu items in the "after" image appear exactly the same as in the "before" image – plain text on a white background, without any visible background color or underlines. Since a hover effect is dynamic, a static image can only demonstrate it if one of the menu items was captured *in* its hovered state, which is not the case here.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts. The instruction describes a dynamic interaction (a hover state). Static images, by their nature, cannot display a dynamic interaction unless the screenshot specifically captures that interactive state. As both images are identical in the menu areas and show no active hover state, it is visually impossible to confirm that the hover effect has been implemented. The provided "after" image shows no visual change related to the instruction.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
