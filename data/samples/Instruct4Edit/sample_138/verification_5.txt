**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims for two primary visual changes in the footer content:
    a.  To make the company details (address, phone) more compact and vertically aligned, meaning elements like phone and fax numbers, if on the same line, should be separated onto individual lines.
    b.  To ensure clear visual separation between this block of company details and the copyright information.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    a.  **Company details re-arrangement (compact, vertically aligned block):**
        *   In the "before" image, the phone and fax numbers were combined on a single line: "TEL: 042-774-2246 FAX: 042-774-1438".
        *   In the "after" image, these have been separated into two distinct, vertically aligned lines:
            "TEL: 042-774-2246"
            "FAX: 042-774-1438"
        *   This change clearly fulfills the instruction to make the block more vertically aligned and more compact horizontally for each line item. This part is visually clear and implemented.

    b.  **Visual separation from copyright information:**
        *   In the "before" image, a horizontal rule (line) already existed directly below the company details, visually separating them from the copyright information.
        *   In the "after" image, this *same* horizontal rule is present in the same style and serves the same purpose. No *new* visual separator was introduced (e.g., a different line style, increased spacing, a distinct background color), nor was the existing separator modified or enhanced in any way to emphasize the separation. The separation was pre-existing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is ambiguity regarding the "visually separating them" part of the instruction. The instruction states "Streamline the footer content *by* arranging... *and* visually separating...". The word "by" implies that both "arranging" and "visually separating" are actions to be *implemented* as part of the design change. While the desired state of visual separation (a line between the sections) is present in the "after" image, it was already present in the "before" image. No *new action* to implement or enhance this separation was visibly taken. Therefore, this specific part of the instruction, implying an action to be taken, was not *implemented* as a new design change.

**Final verdict:**
