Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to convert the plain text links "multi7" and "multi9", which appear below the large image, into visually distinct buttons. These buttons were specifically required to have a clear (solid) background color and slightly rounded corners, making them appear interactive and separate from surrounding text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clear and pronounced.
    *   **Before Image:** "multi7" and "multi9" are simple blue text links, stacked vertically on the left side below the image. They have no background or defined shape.
    *   **After Image:** Both "multi7" and "multi9" have been transformed into rectangular elements. They now have a solid grey background with white text, clearly making them distinct from the page background. Their corners are visibly rounded, satisfying the "slightly rounded corners" requirement. Additionally, their positioning has changed from stacked on the left to "multi7" on the bottom-left and "multi9" on the bottom-right, further enhancing their distinctness as buttons below the image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **"Distinct":** Fully achieved. They are clearly separate visual elements.
    *   **"Clickable buttons":** Visually, they now resemble buttons, implying clickability.
    *   **"Clear background":** Fully achieved with a solid grey background.
    *   **"Slightly rounded corners":** Fully achieved, the corners are visibly rounded.
    *   The instruction did not specify the exact horizontal layout of the two buttons, only that they should be "below the large image" and transformed into buttons. The new layout with "multi7" on the left and "multi9" on the right is a valid implementation that makes them distinct.
