Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests three specific visual changes to the phone number ("TEL. 042-774-2246") and reception hours ("受付時間 9:00 - 18:00 [土・日・祝日除く]") in the top right of the header:
    *   Increase the font size of the phone number.
    *   Increase the font size of the reception hours.
    *   Make the phone number a different color (from its original black).
    *   Make the phone number bold.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size Increase (Phone Number):** In the "after" image, the phone number "TEL. 042-774-2246" is visibly larger than in the "before" image.
    *   **Font Size Increase (Reception Hours):** In the "after" image, the reception hours "受付時間 9:00 - 18:00 [土・日・祝日除く]" are also visibly larger than in the "before" image.
    *   **Different, Bold Color (Phone Number):** In the "after" image, the phone number "TEL. 042-774-2246" has changed from its original black color to a distinct red color, and it is clearly bolded.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    All parts of the instruction—increasing font size for both elements, and making the phone number a different, bold color—have been clearly and completely implemented. There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the changes requested.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
