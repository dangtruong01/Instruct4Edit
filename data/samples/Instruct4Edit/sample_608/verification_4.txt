Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the footer's background color slightly darker. The footer appears to be the dark grey area at the bottom of the first image.
2. In the second image, the dark grey footer is gone and replaced with a white background. This does not match the instruction of making it slightly darker.
3. The instruction is clear but it was not followed.

Final verdict:
