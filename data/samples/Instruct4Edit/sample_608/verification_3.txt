1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the product image and the product details (title, price, add to cart).
2. The product image is missing in the second image. Therefore, it is impossible to verify the spacing change between the product image and product details.
3. The image is missing from the second image, making it impossible to determine if the instruction has been applied.
