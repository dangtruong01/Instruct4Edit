Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the layout and spacing of the contact information (phone numbers, addresses) and copyright details in the footer. Specifically, it requests:
    *   **Reorganization:** A change in the arrangement of these elements.
    *   **Improved Readability:** A general goal, often achieved through better spacing, grouping, and hierarchy.
    *   **More Vertical Breathing Room:** Increased space between lines, paragraphs, or distinct blocks of text vertically.
    *   **More Horizontal Breathing Room:** Increased space between elements horizontally, reducing visual clutter.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the changes are clearly visible and significant:
    *   **Reorganization:**
        *   In the "before" image, the copyright and email are on the far left, while the phone numbers and addresses are tightly packed together on the right, misaligned with the copyright. The "Разработка сайта" text is at the very bottom right.
        *   In the "after" image, the copyright and email remain on the far left. The "Разработка сайта" text has moved up and is now horizontally aligned with the copyright, creating a clearer bottom line. The phone numbers and addresses have been grouped together in a central block, introduced by a bold "Контактная информация:" heading. This is a clear restructuring of the footer content.
    *   **More Vertical Breathing Room:**
        *   In the "after" image, there is noticeable vertical space added. For instance, the "Контактная информация:" heading is separate, with space above and below it. There's more space between the phone numbers block and the addresses block. The entire contact information block is now more distinct from the copyright information, due to increased vertical separation.
    *   **More Horizontal Breathing Room:**
        *   In the "before" image, the contact numbers and addresses were cramped horizontally on the right side.
        *   In the "after" image, the contact information (numbers and addresses) now occupies a distinct central column, no longer trying to fit on the right margin. This naturally provides more horizontal space around these elements, especially on the right side of the footer, which was previously dense. The "Разработка сайта" text is now pushed further right, creating more space between it and the central contact block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction was comprehensive, and all aspects—reorganization, vertical spacing, and horizontal spacing—have been effectively implemented, leading to a visually clearer and more readable footer.
