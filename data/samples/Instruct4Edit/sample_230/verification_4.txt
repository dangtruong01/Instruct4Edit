**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to change the appearance of the bullet points within the main news article content. Specifically, it requests a change from "bold dots" (which appear as large, prominent solid circles in the 'before' image) to "standard, modern bullet symbols" (which typically implies a smaller, less visually heavy, perhaps default HTML bullet point or a similar contemporary style).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon close comparison of the bullet points under the heading "Тематика мероприятия включает, но не ограничивается следующими главными темами:" in both images, the bullet symbols remain identical. They are still large, prominent solid black circles in the "after" image, just as they were in the "before" image. The appearance has not changed to a "standard, modern bullet symbol."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the lack of change. The instruction was clearly to *update* the bullet points, and visually, no update has occurred.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
