As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the "before" and "after" images based on your instruction.

**Instruction:** Increase the spacing between the main horizontal navigation items and add a subtle visual change when you hover over them.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The primary navigation items, which were previously displayed vertically (e.g., "Методология и консалтинг", "Автоматизация бизнес-процессов"), should be rearranged to appear in a horizontal row.
    *   Once arranged horizontally, the empty space between these items should be visibly increased.
    *   There should be an interactive visual effect (e.g., a color change, an underline, a background highlight) that appears when a user's mouse cursor is positioned over each navigation item. This effect should be subtle.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Horizontal arrangement:** Yes, in the "after" image, the navigation items ("Методология и консалтинг", "Автоматизация бизнес-процессов", "Внедрение информационных систем", "Внедрение для бюджетных учреждений", "Обучение и сертификация пользователей") have clearly been transformed from a vertical list to a horizontal row. This foundational change aligns with the implied need for "horizontal navigation items."
    *   **Increased spacing:** Yes, the new horizontal arrangement clearly features visual spacing between each navigation item. Compared to their stacked, vertical appearance in the "before" image (where there was no horizontal spacing at all between these specific items), the "after" image shows distinct and increased horizontal separation.
    *   **Subtle visual change on hover:** **No, this change is NOT visible or verifiable.** The provided images are static screenshots, which do not allow for the observation or confirmation of interactive hover states.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Doubt/Missing Element:** The "subtle visual change when you hover over them" cannot be verified due to the static nature of the provided images. This is a critical functional requirement that remains unconfirmed.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied

**Reasoning:** While the layout transformation to horizontal navigation and the increased spacing are visually evident and appear correctly implemented, the instruction explicitly includes "add a subtle visual change when you hover over them." As a cautious reviewer, I cannot confirm the implementation of a dynamic hover effect from static images. Therefore, the instruction cannot be deemed "Fully Applied" because a key part of it remains unverified.
