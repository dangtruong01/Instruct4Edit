Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a more defined border and a subtle shadow to the input field.
2. Comparing the two images, I see no changes in the appearance of the input field. The border is the same, and there is no shadow.
3. The instruction has not been implemented in the modified image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
