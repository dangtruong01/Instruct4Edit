Step-by-step justification:
1. The intention is to make the navigation bar fixed at the top while scrolling down. To see if this is applied, one would ideally see the navigation bar at the top while content below it would be partially hidden due to scrolling.
2. The images provided are static screenshots of the same page. It is impossible to assess whether the navigation bar is sticky without an interactive or scrolling view. Both images are identical, the navigation bar doesn't show any sign of stickiness.
3. The prompt is impossible to assess with the information provided, as the sticky function can only be evaluated on a scrolling view.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
