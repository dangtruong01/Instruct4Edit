Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the forum tables to make them more visually distinct. This should be visible as a larger gap between the individual tables.
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the table rows appears to be identical. I don't observe any change in the spacing between forum tables.
3. There is no ambiguity. The instruction is straightforward, but no changes are observed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
