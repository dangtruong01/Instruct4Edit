Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color of the logo area so that it complements both the logo and the navigation bar below.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no apparent change in the background color of the logo area. The "Castle of Dracula" area at the top left still has the same color.
3. There is no visible change.

Final verdict:
