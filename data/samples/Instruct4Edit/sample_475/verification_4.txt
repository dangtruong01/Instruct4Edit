Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires softening the sharp corners of the boxes to make them slightly rounded.
2. By comparing the two images, I can't see any visible change in the corners of the boxes. The boxes still appear to have sharp corners.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change wasn't applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
