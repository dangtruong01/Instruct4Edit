Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow effect to the forum category titles, exemplified by "Castle of Dracula". The aim is to visually separate these titles from their backgrounds.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot clearly see any shadow effect added to the category titles. The text appearance remains almost identical.
3. There are no visible shadow effects added, so the instruction was not followed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
