Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the footer links to match the other text in the footer. This means the footer links, which are visually distinct in the before image, should have the same color as the copyright text in the after image.
2. By comparing the two images, the links are still visually distinct from the other text, indicating the change has not been applied.
3. It appears the color change for the links in the footer was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
