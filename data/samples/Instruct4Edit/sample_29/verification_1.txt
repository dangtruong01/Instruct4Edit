Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The main heading, "MiraMarkets Com - жалоба на РАЗВОДИЛ (видео-отзыв)", should have its background color changed to match the background color of the surrounding section.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The background color of the heading remains white in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction's effect is not visually apparent.

Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied
