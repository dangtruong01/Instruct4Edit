Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Change the chat box's color to a lighter one and add a visible border.
2.  **Visibility of change:** The "chat box" is the main content area of the webpage. It's unclear what the "chat box" is in the images. It looks like the design change was to the content area. Both images have white backgrounds for the content area, and I see no visible border.
3.  **Doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements:** The instruction refers to a "chat box," which is not explicitly identifiable in the images. The white background does not change. No border is added.

Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied
