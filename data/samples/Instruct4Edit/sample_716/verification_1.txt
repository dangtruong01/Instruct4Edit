Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for changes to the navigation buttons. This involves giving them a background color that contrasts with the page background and using a brighter text color to improve their visibility.
2. In the "after" image, there are no visible navigation buttons, so the changes described in the instruction cannot be assessed. It's possible the navigation buttons are missing altogether or are obscured/removed.
3. There are no navigation buttons that I can see in either image.

Final verdict:
