Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the "Zapisz się" buttons a brighter, more attention-grabbing color.
2. Comparing the two images, the "Zapisz się" buttons at the top and in the middle appear to be more orange in the second image compared to the first, indicating a change in color towards a brighter, more attention-grabbing hue. The "Zapisz się" button at the bottom, however, remained the same, which is a yellow/orange color.
3. The instruction was implemented for some but not all of the buttons.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
