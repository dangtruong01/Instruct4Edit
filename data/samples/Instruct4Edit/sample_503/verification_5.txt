Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to center the copyright text in the footer.
2. The "after" image shows the copyright text aligned to the left, just like in the "before" image. Thus, the requested change was not applied.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
