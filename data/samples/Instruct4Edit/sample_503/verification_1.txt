Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle background color to the navigation menu items on hover. The navigation menu items are "Oferta", "O nas", "Certyfikaty", "Kontakt", and "EN".
2. I cannot hover over the items in the images, therefore, I cannot tell if the instruction was applied.
3. It is unclear if the design change was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
