Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction specifies that the "copyright information and associated links" should be horizontally centered within the footer area, which is located at the very bottom of the page.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes.
In the "before" image, the copyright text ("Copyright by P.H.P.U REMAG Waga Wózki paletowe...") and the associated link ("Dowiedz się więcej") within the dark grey footer bar are clearly left-aligned.
In the "after" image, the exact same text and link are now visibly centered horizontally within that same dark grey footer bar. The content itself and its position at the very bottom of the page remain unchanged, only its horizontal alignment within that space has shifted as requested.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The change is unambiguous and precisely implemented. The identified content (copyright text and link) has been centered as instructed, and it remains at the specified location (very bottom of the page).

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
