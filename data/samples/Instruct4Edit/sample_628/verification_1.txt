Here's my review:

**Instruction:** Make the company logo in the top section of the page larger so it's more prominent.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The company logo, "P.H.P.U. REMAG WAGA RS," located in the white bar at the top of the page, should increase in its visual dimensions (width and/or height) to appear more significant or eye-catching.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, the company logo (P.H.P.U. REMAG WAGA RS) appears to be exactly the same size in both images. There is no discernible increase in its dimensions. The overall layout and spacing around the logo also appear unchanged.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no ambiguity: the intended change (making the logo larger) has not been implemented. The logo's size remains identical.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
