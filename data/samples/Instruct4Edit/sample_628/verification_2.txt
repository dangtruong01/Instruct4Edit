Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific changes to the section containing the page title ("Wózek dwukołowy WRN1-020/55"):
    *   Change its background color from the existing orange to a solid, darker shade.
    *   Increase its height slightly to provide more vertical breathing room around the title.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Color Change:** In the "before" image, the background of the title section is an orange/brown hue. In the "after" image, this background has been changed to a dark, solid grey color. This is a clear and visible shift to a "solid, darker shade."
    *   **Height Increase:** Comparing the two images, the section containing the title in the "after" image is visibly taller than in the "before" image. There is more vertical padding above and below the title text, clearly providing the requested "more breathing room."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both parts of the instruction (color change and height increase) have been clearly and completely implemented as specified. The new color is unambiguously darker and solid, and the increased height is noticeable.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
