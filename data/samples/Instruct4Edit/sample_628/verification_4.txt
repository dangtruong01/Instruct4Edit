Here's the review of the visual changes:

---

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to expand the main product details content horizontally. This means removing the empty white space (referred to as "blank side panels") that was previously present on the left and right sides of this central content block. The goal is for this content to occupy more horizontal room and effectively span the full available width of the content area.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible.
*   In the "before" image, the main product details (starting from the "Wózek dwukołowy WRN1-020/55" heading down to the product symbol table) are constrained to a fixed, narrower width with significant blank margins on both sides.
*   In the "after" image, these blank margins have been removed. The "Wózek dwukołowy WRN1-020/55" heading (the gold background bar) now spans the entire width of the page's main content area, from immediately after the left navigation panel to the right edge of the viewport.
*   The product description text, bullet points, image, and the "SYMBOL" table below it have also expanded horizontally, utilizing the full available width, which was previously occupied by the "blank side panels."

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The instruction specifically targeted the "blank side panels on either side of the main product details." It did not instruct to remove the persistent left navigation menu or other parts of the overall page layout. The main product details content has successfully expanded to fill the "full width" of its designated content area, indicating a complete and clear implementation of the instruction.
