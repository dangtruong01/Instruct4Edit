Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the vertical space above and below the article content within the main section of the page. This means the space between the top of the article title "Board gives push to zoning change" and the header, as well as the space between the end of the article text "...Pennsylvania" and the footer, should be decreased.
2. Comparing the two images, it appears there is a reduction in the amount of space above and below the article content within the main section.
3. I see a visible reduction in both top and bottom spacing around the article content.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
