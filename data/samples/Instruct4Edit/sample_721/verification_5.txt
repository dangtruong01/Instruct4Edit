Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies that the background gradient, which transitions from red to black, should be smoother with a less abrupt change.
2. By comparing the two images, I can observe that the modified image exhibits a smoother gradient transition from red to black compared to the original image. The boundary between the two colors is less sharp.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The modification seems to fulfill the instructions.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
