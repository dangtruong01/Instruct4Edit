Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the visual separation between social media icons in the footer. This would likely be achieved by increasing the spacing between the icons.
2. Neither the first image nor the second image contains social media icons. The footer consists of text links, not icons. There is no change visible.
3. The task cannot be completed as there are no social media icons in either image's footer.

Final verdict:
