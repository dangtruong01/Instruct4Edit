Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to remove the visual underlining from two specific categories of text: "introductory paragraphs" and "contact information paragraphs." This change was intended to improve the overall modern appearance and readability of these text blocks.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Introductory Paragraphs:** In the "before" image, the two main introductory text blocks ("Los servicios del Estudio Contable Impositivo AGML..." and "El Estudio AGML le dará el asesoramiento...") do not have any underlining. Therefore, no change was required or applied to these sections in the "after" image, which aligns with the instruction to *remove* existing underlining.
    *   **Contact Information Paragraphs:** In the "before" image, the lines providing contact details ("Estudio AGML : Estudio Contable Impositivo", "Te. 4571-6059", "Cel 156-8021497", and "Correo: Esta dirección de correo electrónico está siendo protegida contra los robots de spam. Necesita tener JavaScript habilitado para poder verlo.") are all underlined. In the "after" image, the underlining from all these contact information lines has been completely and clearly removed. This change is fully visible and implemented.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is a potential ambiguity regarding the bulleted list of services (e.g., "Alta de impuestos y regimenes de información," "Asesoramiento impositivo," etc.). Many of these list items are underlined in the "before" image and remain underlined in the "after" image. While these items convey *introductory information*, the instruction specifically uses the term "paragraphs." In UI/UX terminology, bulleted list items are typically distinct from paragraphs. If the instruction's intent was to remove underlining from *all* descriptive text (including list items) to achieve a modern appearance, then this part of the "introductory information" was not addressed. However, strictly interpreting the instruction's use of "paragraphs," the change was correctly applied to the text blocks that fit this description (the contact information). As a cautious reviewer, it's important to highlight this potential scope discrepancy; while the explicit instruction for "paragraphs" was met, the broader goal of "modern appearance and readability" might have implied a more comprehensive removal of non-link underlining that was not fully executed on the list items. Nevertheless, based on the literal wording, the specified *paragraphs* were handled correctly.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
