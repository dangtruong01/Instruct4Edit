Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction dictates that the company logo, which was previously located in the top-left corner of the header, should be moved and positioned horizontally in the center of the header section. It also implies that the actual company logo replaced a placeholder.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes.
    *   In the "before" image, there is a small, generic placeholder icon in the top-left corner of the blue header.
    *   In the "after" image, this placeholder has been replaced by a clear "AGML" logo.
    *   This new "AGML" logo is distinctly positioned in the horizontal center of the blue header section, relative to the overall page width.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The company logo has been identified, replaced, and then clearly centered within the header section as instructed.

Final verdict:
