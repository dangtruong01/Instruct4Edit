Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requires the "currently active item" in the main navigation bar (which appears to be "Inicio") to be visually modified. This modification should either be:
    *   A distinct background color, or
    *   A thicker underline.
    The goal is to make it stand out *more* or *differently* than it did before.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Upon careful comparison of the "Inicio" item and the entire navigation bar area, there is absolutely no discernible visual difference between the "before" and "after" images. The "Inicio" text color remains light blue/white in both, and no new background color or thicker underline has been applied.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the implementation. The instruction was to *give* a distinct background or a *thicker* underline, implying a change from the existing state. Since there is no visual change at all, the instruction has not been implemented.
