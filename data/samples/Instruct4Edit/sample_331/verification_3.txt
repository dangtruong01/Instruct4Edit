Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to center the main title, "Departamento Impuestos," horizontally within its content section on the page.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. In the "before" image, the title "Departamento Impuestos" is left-aligned. In the "after" image, the title has been moved horizontally and now appears to be centered within the main content area of the page.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The centering is visually clear and unambiguous. The instruction was precise ("center the main title," "within its section"), and the visual result perfectly matches it.

**Final verdict:**
