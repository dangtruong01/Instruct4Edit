Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aimed to improve the scannability of the list of services by introducing either a small, subtle icon or a distinct, non-default bullet point style (e.g., a square, a dash, a different color/shape from the standard disc, or a custom graphic) next to each list item.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No.
    *   **Before Image:** The list items use standard default black disc bullet points.
    *   **After Image:** The list items still use standard default black disc bullet points. No new icons have been added, and the style of the bullet points remains unchanged and is not "unique" compared to the original or to typical browser defaults.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There is no ambiguity. Neither an icon nor a unique bullet point style has been applied to the list items. The visual appearance of the bullets is identical in both images.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
