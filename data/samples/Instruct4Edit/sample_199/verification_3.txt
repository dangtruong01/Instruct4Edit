Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies adding padding or a subtle border to the audio player to create visual separation from the text below.
2. In the modified image, the audio player (the orange box) is no longer present. Thus, the instruction to add padding or a border could not have been applied.
3. The instruction could not be fully applied as the audio player element is not visible in the after image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
