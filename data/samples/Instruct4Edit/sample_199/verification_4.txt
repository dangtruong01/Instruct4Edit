Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the horizontal spacing between the footer widgets ("Archives", "Categories", the copyright notice, and the previous/next post links) to reduce the feeling of clutter.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, it is clear that the "Archives" and "Categories" sections are now spaced further apart. Also, the spacing between the copyright info and the previous/next post links has increased.
3. The change is clear and directly addresses the instruction.

Final verdict:
