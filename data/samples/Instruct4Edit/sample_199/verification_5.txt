Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to move the "Scroll to Top" arrow further inward, away from the edge of the screen, to improve visual balance.
2. There is no "Scroll to Top" arrow visible in either the before or after images.
3. Since the element to be modified is not present, the instruction cannot be applied.

Final verdict:
