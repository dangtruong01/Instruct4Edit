Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies that the selected tab should be more visually prominent due to a color change.
2. Looking at the two images, there's no visual difference between the tabs in the "before" and "after" images. The tabs appear identical in terms of color and highlighting.
3. There's no color change or any visual modification to indicate which tab is currently selected.

Final verdict:
