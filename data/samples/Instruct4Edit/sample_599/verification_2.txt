Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to move the "Posted" date and time information, which is currently located at the bottom of the image, to directly underneath the main job title (which is not visible in the image but assumed to be at the top).
2. I don't see any job title in the images provided. There is no date and time information near the top in the modified image.
3. The instruction is unclear because the main job title is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
