Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the main navigation menu at the top of the page sticky, so it remains visible while the user scrolls down.
2. By comparing the before and after images, there is no visible indication that the main navigation menu has been made sticky. The navigation menu appears to be in the same position in both images.
3. There is no visual change in the after image indicating the change was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
