Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the logo to be smaller, positioned to the left, and the "Recent Posts" section to be aligned vertically to the right of it.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the logo appears to be smaller and positioned on the left. The "Recent Posts" section is not visible in the after image, so I cannot verify if it's aligned to the right of the logo. However, there's a section called "Latest Jobs" which has moved down the page in the after image.
3. Since the instruction specifically mentions "Recent Posts" which is not present in the 'after' image, and "Latest Jobs" is moved further down the page, I am unsure if the instructions were fully applied as it is difficult to verify without the "Recent Posts" section being present.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
