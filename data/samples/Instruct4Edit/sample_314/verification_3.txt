Here's a breakdown of the visual changes and my assessment:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to move the section labeled "摘要" (summary) to a position visually *before* the image. This implies the section should appear above the image.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    The original image *does not contain* a clear image in its current layout. This makes the instruction difficult to interpret or implement. Thus the requested change is likely not fully implementable as written.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction is ambiguous because there is no immediately obvious image to rearrange the summary section relative to.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
