Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to increase the size and weight (boldness) of the main heading text.
2. Comparing the two images, the main heading in the "after" image appears to be slightly larger and bolder.
3. While an improvement, the change is minimal, and the heading is only marginally larger and bolder.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
