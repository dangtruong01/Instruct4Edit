Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical empty space (padding/margin) around key content sections on the page. This is intended to create more visual breathing room, reduce clutter, and enhance the separation between different content blocks, thereby improving the overall readability and visual hierarchy.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible and consistently applied.
    *   The space between the initial blue call-to-action ("We really hope this helps you!") and the subsequent text ("Feel free to reach out...") has increased.
    *   The space between "Feel free to reach out..." and "Ready to be the beast..." has increased.
    *   The space between "Ready to be the beast..." and the green "GET A FREE QUOTE" button has increased.
    *   A significant amount of vertical empty space (a new dark grey background strip) has been added directly below the green "GET A FREE QUOTE" button and above the image of the man.
    *   Another significant amount of vertical empty space (a continuation of the dark grey background strip) has been added directly below the image of the man and above the lower "GET A FREE QUOTE" heading.
    *   The space between the bottom form fields (and "Send" button) and the "FEATURED ON UpCity" badge/footer section has noticeably increased.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was to "increase the empty space both above and below each major content block," and this has been thoroughly and visibly applied across the page, creating distinct separations where content blocks previously felt cramped.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
