Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that the main title "We really hope this helps you!" should be changed to a bolder font weight and a deeper shade of blue.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, the intended changes are not clearly visible. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the text "We really hope this helps you!" appears to have the exact same font weight (it is not bolder) and the exact same shade of blue (it is not a deeper shade) in both versions. There is no discernible visual difference in either aspect.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction was to make the text "bolder" and a "deeper shade of blue." Visually, neither of these changes has been applied to the text in the "after" image. The element remains unchanged from its "before" state.

**Final verdict:**
