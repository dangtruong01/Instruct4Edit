**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific visual changes to the input fields within the "GET A FREE QUOTE" form:
    *   Add a subtle, light grey background.
    *   Add a thin border around them.
    The overall goal is to make these fields clearer and more distinct.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the input fields (three large ones and two smaller ones near the "SEND" button) are predominantly white and blend almost entirely with the white background of the content area, making them difficult to discern as interactive elements.
    *   In the "after" image, all five input fields now consistently display a very light grey background fill. This background is subtle, as requested, but sufficiently present to distinguish the fields from their surroundings.
    *   Additionally, a thin, light grey border is now clearly visible around each of these input fields, further enhancing their definition and making them stand out as interactive elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. Both parts of the instruction ("subtle, light grey background" and "thin border") have been applied precisely as specified to all the input fields in the designated form. The change effectively makes the fields clearer without being overly intrusive.

**Final verdict:**
