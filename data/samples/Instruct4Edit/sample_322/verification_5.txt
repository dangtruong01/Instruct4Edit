**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that "all the text and links in the very bottom footer section" should be made "brighter" to "stand out more clearly against the dark background."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the very bottom footer section in both images (containing text like "©2022 C2 MEDIA. All Rights Reserved. | Designed by C2 MEDIA | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy"), there is no visible difference in the brightness or color of the text. The text appears to be the exact same dark gray in both the "before" and "after" images, blending into the dark background rather than standing out more clearly.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction to make the text brighter has not been implemented at all. The text's color and visibility remain unchanged.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
