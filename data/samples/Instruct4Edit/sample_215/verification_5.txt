Here is the review of the visual change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to lighten the background color of the webpage, specifically the area surrounding the main white content box. The purpose is to reduce the starkness and create a softer visual contrast.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, the background color is a deep, dark blue.
    *   In the "after" image, the background color is a noticeably lighter shade of blue, appearing as a soft, muted blue-grey.
    *   The central white content box (containing the text "TARDIEU, Ambroise." and the main biographical content) remains white in both images.
    *   The contrast between this white content box and the surrounding background is visibly softer in the "after" image compared to the "before" image, where the dark blue created a much higher contrast.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the change is clear and unambiguously applies the instruction. The background color has been lightened, and this change directly results in a softer contrast around the white content area as requested.

**Final verdict:**
