---

**Step-by-step justification:**

**Part 1: Update the "Schuh’s Annotated Bio-Bibliography" title font to a more professional, non-script typeface.**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The font of the title "Schuh’s Annotated Bio-Bibliography" should be changed. The new font should be non-script (i.e., not a cursive or handwriting style) and convey a more professional appearance.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. In the "before" image, the title uses a decorative serif typeface that, while not strictly a script, has an older, more stylized feel. In the "after" image, the font has been changed to a clear, clean sans-serif typeface (e.g., Arial or Helvetica equivalent). This new font is unequivocally non-script and generally perceived as more modern and professional.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No doubts. The font change clearly adheres to the instruction.

**Part 2: Make the "Return to main Biobliography page" link look like a more prominent, distinct button.**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The text link "Return to main Biobliography page" should be transformed from a simple text link into a more noticeable and clearly defined button element. This typically involves adding a background, padding, and potentially a border to give it a button-like appearance.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. In the "before" image, it is a plain purple text link with an underline. In the "after" image, it has been transformed into a rectangular shape with a solid purple background and white text, making it distinct and clearly identifiable as a button. It is significantly more prominent than the original text link.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No doubts. The transformation into a distinct button is clear and effective.
