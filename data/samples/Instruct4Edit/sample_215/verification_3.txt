Here's my detailed review:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two changes to the "main white content area":
    *   A "subtle rounded border" around this area.
    *   This change is intended to give a "softer look," which implies that the current sharp corners of the white area should be rounded.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The main white content area (the large central block containing all text, the logo, and the blue horizontal rule) has sharp, 90-degree corners where it meets the surrounding blue background. There is no visible border line around this area; it simply abuts the blue background.
    *   **After Image:** Upon close inspection, the main white content area remains unchanged. Its corners are still sharp and 90-degree, and there is no new "subtle rounded border" visible around it. The appearance is identical to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction clearly calls for a visual modification (rounded corners and a border) to the prominent white content area. No such modification is present in the "after" image. The design change appears to be entirely missing.

**Final verdict:**
