**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to significantly reduce the vertical empty space located directly above the "Follow" social media links at the very bottom of the main content area, just before the copyright footer.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon close comparison, the vertical spacing between the end of the main text content (the last solitary `.` character) and the "Follow" links remains identical in both the "before" and "after" images. The "Follow" links themselves and the surrounding elements (the text above, the footer below) appear to be in the exact same positions relative to each other in both versions. There is no discernible decrease in the specified empty space.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instructed change is entirely missing. The "large empty space" above the social media icons has not been decreased at all.

**Final verdict:**
