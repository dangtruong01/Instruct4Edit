Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a hover effect (underline or color change) to the main navigation links at the top of the page.
2. By comparing the two images, it is not possible to see any changes to the navigation links. There is no visual cue (underline or color change) on the modified image. It is not applied.
3. There are doubts, as the instruction doesn't give specific details, but no change has happened from the before image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
