Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Increase the size and boldness of the main navigation menu links.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the navigation links are visibly larger and bolder in the "after" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
