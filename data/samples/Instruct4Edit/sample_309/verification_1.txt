Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction requests that the main title text should be larger and bolder. The main title text appears to be "The One-Line Review Presents".

2.  **Visibility of Change:** Comparing the two images, the "The One-Line Review Presents" text in the modified image appears larger and bolder than in the original image.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
