Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to add a subtle border around the content of each blog post. This means each distinct post section should have a visual separation, likely a thin line surrounding the text and elements within that post.

2.  **Visibility of Change:** I do not see any subtle borders around the blog post content. The second image appears nearly identical to the first, with no new visual separation around the blog post content.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The instruction was clear; the expected outcome (a border) is missing.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
