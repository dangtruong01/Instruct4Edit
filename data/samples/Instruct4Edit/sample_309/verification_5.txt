Here's a breakdown of my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction aims to decrease the vertical space (margin or padding) above and below the post titles (e.g., "Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941)").

2.  **Visibility in the After Image:** The spacing above and below the post title in the "after" image appears unchanged compared to the "before" image.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The instruction seems straightforward, but the spacing around "Here Comes Mr. Jordan (1941)" is visually the same in both images.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
