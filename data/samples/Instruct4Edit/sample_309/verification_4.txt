Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction asks to change the background color of the sidebar to light gray. The sidebar's background should become visually lighter.
2.  **Visibility:** The background color of the sidebar appears the same in both images.
3.  **Doubts and ambiguities:** The background color of the sidebar was not changed.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
