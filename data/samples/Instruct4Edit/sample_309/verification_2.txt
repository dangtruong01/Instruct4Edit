Here's a breakdown of my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction asks for an increase in the spacing between the title and the description within the header. The title is "The One-Line Review Presents", and the description is "The 50 Greatest Films."

2.  **Change Visibility:** While the title and the description appear to be slightly different, the images are too similar. It is not clear if the spacing has increased.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The visual change might be subtle or not present at all.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
