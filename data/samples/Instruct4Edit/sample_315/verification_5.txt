Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle border to be added around the displayed image, separating it visually from the background.
2. Comparing the images, there is no visible border around the image in the "after" image that was not present in the "before" image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
