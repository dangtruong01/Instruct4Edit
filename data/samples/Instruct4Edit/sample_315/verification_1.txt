Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the background color of the main navigation to a dark gray. The main navigation is likely located at the top of the image or somewhere easily identifiable.
2. In the after image, the background behind the main navigation elements ("Browse", "Photographers", "Purchasing", "Flagging", "Revs Institute") has been changed to a dark gray. This is a clear and visible change compared to the before image, where the background was white.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible and applied to the intended area.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
