Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase the blank space around the central content area (where the blog post is displayed, including the car image and related text/button). This should create more visual breathing room, particularly on the left and right sides, separating the content from the page edges.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the main content block (encompassing the "ANKARA GELIN ARABASI SÜSLEME" heading, the car image, and the "Diğer yayınları yükle" button) has significantly more empty space on its left and right sides compared to the "before" image. The content area appears to have been constrained to a narrower column, effectively pushing it further away from the page's horizontal edges.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifically highlighted increasing space "especially on the sides," and this is precisely what has been implemented and is immediately noticeable. The overall empty space around the main content has indeed increased horizontally.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
