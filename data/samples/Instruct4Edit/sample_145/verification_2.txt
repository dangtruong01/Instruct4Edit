Here's the analysis of the design change:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to make three pieces of information – the blog post title, date, and a short text snippet – perpetually visible directly below each blog post preview image. This means they should not be hidden and only appear on user interaction (like hovering).

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** The area directly below the blog post image is empty. There is no visible title, date, or text snippet.
*   **After Image:** Directly below the same blog post image, the following elements are clearly visible:
    *   **Post Title:** "Siyah Audi Q3 Gelin Arabası Süsleme"
    *   **Date:** "Kasım 04, 2022"
    *   **Short Snippet of Text:** "Siyah gelin arabası süsleme Bu gelin arabası süslemesinde siyah audi q3 modelini süsledik. T..." (followed by a "DEVAMINI OKU" button, confirming it's a snippet).

This change is highly visible and directly addresses the instruction. The previously hidden/non-existent information is now prominently displayed.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the implementation on the visible blog post preview. The title, date, and snippet are all present, directly below the image, and are always visible in the "after" state, as requested. While only one blog post preview is fully visible in the images, the change is perfectly applied to that instance, demonstrating full compliance with the instruction's intent.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
