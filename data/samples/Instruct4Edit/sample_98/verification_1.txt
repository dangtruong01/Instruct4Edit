Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intended to visually merge a search input field and an adjacent search button into a single, cohesive element without any visual separation (gaps). This implies that a button should be present next to the input field and styled to appear as part of it.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, this change is not visible. Upon careful comparison, the search input field area in the "before" image is *identical* to the "after" image. In both images, there is only a standalone white rectangular input field at the top left, and crucially, *no visible button* next to it.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there are significant missing elements. The primary issue is that the "button" component mentioned in the instruction ("search input field and **its button**") is entirely absent from both the "before" and "after" images. Since the button is missing, the instruction to make it appear as one continuous element with the input field cannot possibly have been applied or verified. There is no change in the visual appearance or layout of the search input area between the two images.

**Final verdict:**
