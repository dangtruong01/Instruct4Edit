Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to soften the vibrant blue background color of the 'Expert In' and 'Links' section headers. The suggested softer colors are a lighter tone or a subtle grey.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the 'before' image, both 'Expert In' and 'Links' headers have a distinct, vibrant blue background. In the 'after' image, the background color for both headers has been changed to a light, subtle grey, which is a significant softening from the original blue.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements regarding this specific instruction. The color change is evident, and the chosen color (a light grey) aligns perfectly with the instruction's suggestion of "a subtle grey" to soften the original vibrant blue.

**Final verdict:**
