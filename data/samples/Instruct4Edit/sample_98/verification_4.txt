As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have meticulously compared the "before" and "after" images to assess the implementation of the provided instruction.

---

**Instruction:** Display the list of expertise areas horizontally, like individual tags, with some space around each one, instead of stacking them vertically.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction targets the "Expert In" section, specifically the list of expertise areas (e.g., "Astrophysics", "Dark matter detection"). The goal was to change their layout from the current vertical stacking to a horizontal arrangement, styled like individual tags with spacing.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of both images, I can confirm that there is **no visible change whatsoever** in the "Expert In" section. The list of expertise areas remains stacked vertically in the "after" image, identical to the "before" image. No horizontal arrangement, tag-like styling, or additional spacing around the items has been applied.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction was clear, and the intended visual change is easily identifiable. However, the change has simply not been implemented. The "after" image is an exact duplicate of the "before" image in the relevant area.
