Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to decrease the visual emphasis of the light gray bordered box containing the contact information (Edmonton, Alberta; email address; office phone number) within the main profile section. This would typically involve making its border less distinct (e.g., lighter, thinner, or removed) or changing its background color to better match the surrounding white background, thereby making it "blend in more."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible at all. A direct comparison of the "before" and "after" images reveals that the bordered box containing the contact information is identical in both. The border style, border color, background fill color, and text within that box are precisely the same in the "after" image as they were in the "before" image. There has been no alteration to reduce its visual prominence or make it blend in more.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The specific element targeted by the instruction shows no visual change whatsoever between the two images. The instruction was completely unaddressed.

Final verdict:
