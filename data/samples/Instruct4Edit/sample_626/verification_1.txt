**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies that the 'Learn more' button (identified as "Узнать больше!" in Russian) on the yellow announcement bar at the top of the page should change its appearance. It should transition from its current state as a solid black block with white text to an outline style with dark text. This implies a transparent or light background for the button, a dark border, and dark text inside.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the 'Learn more' button ("Узнать больше!") located on the yellow announcement bar appears visually identical in both images. It consistently displays as a solid black rectangular block with white text.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The button's style (solid black background, white text) has not changed at all in the "after" image. It does not display as an outline, nor does it have dark text. The instruction was clearly not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
