Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to visually connect the phone number ("8 495 369 60 95") more closely with the main logo area or brand name ("Академия" or "Брайана Трейси") at the very top of the page. This implies either repositioning the phone number, placing it directly below or next to the brand name, or adding a distinct icon to emphasize its connection to the logo/brand.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No, there is absolutely no visible change. In both the "before" and "after" images, the phone number "8 495 369 60 95" remains in the exact same position, located under the word "Академия" in the left-hand navigation column. It has not been moved closer to any main logo area at the top of the page, nor has any distinct icon been added next to it.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts; the instruction appears to be completely unaddressed. The phone number's position and styling are identical in both images. It has not been integrated into the header/logo area at the top, nor has its proximity to the "Академия" text changed, which itself is not the "main logo area at the top of the page" as per the instruction's wording.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
