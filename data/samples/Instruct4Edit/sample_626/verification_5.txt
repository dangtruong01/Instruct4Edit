**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the visual organization of the footer section. Specifically, it requests changes to the alignment and spacing of three types of elements: copyright information, navigation links, and branding text. The goal is to ensure these elements are "evenly distributed" (implying a balanced spread across the available width) and "clearly separated" (meaning distinct visual boundaries or spacing between groups).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image Analysis:** The footer in the "before" image is vertically stacked and left-aligned.
        *   "© 2017 - Брайн Трейси" (copyright) is on the first line.
        *   "Видео-уроки", "Семинары", "Партнерская программа", "Акселераторы продаж" (navigation links) are listed vertically below the copyright.
        *   "Всегда лучшие идеи" (branding text) is on a separate line at the very bottom.
        *   The elements are not evenly distributed horizontally, nor are they clearly separated into distinct groups horizontally.

    *   **After Image Analysis:** The footer in the "after" image shows a dramatic transformation to a horizontal layout.
        *   "© 2017 - Брайн Трейси" (copyright) is now on the far left.
        *   "Видео-уроки", "Семинары", "Партнерская программа", "Акселераторы продаж" (navigation links) are now horizontally aligned and grouped in the center.
        *   "Всегда лучшие идеи" (branding text) is now on the far right.
        *   This new arrangement clearly demonstrates a significant adjustment in alignment and spacing. The three specified element types are now spread across the footer area, appearing to be "evenly distributed" across the horizontal space. They are also "clearly separated" by the substantial horizontal gaps between the copyright, navigation links, and branding text.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the visual changes are very clear and directly address all parts of the instruction. The shift from a vertical, stacked layout to a horizontal, space-distributed layout directly achieves "adjust the alignment and spacing," "evenly distributed," and "clearly separated" for the copyright, navigation links, and branding text.

**Final verdict:**
