**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to make the "Call Today" offers within the business listings more visually prominent and noticeable. This was suggested to be achieved by either applying a brighter background color or a bolder border around them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, "Call Today" is a simple blue text link. In the "after" image, it has been transformed into a distinct button-like element.
    *   It now has a solid green background color, which makes it stand out significantly compared to having no background.
    *   It has a visible border around it, which was completely absent before.
    *   The text color has also changed from blue to white, increasing its contrast against the new green background and further enhancing its prominence.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction provided suggestions ("perhaps with a brighter background color *or* a bolder border"), and the modified design successfully implemented both a new background color *and* a border, effectively making the element stand out more as requested. The implementation is clear and unambiguous.

**Final verdict:**
