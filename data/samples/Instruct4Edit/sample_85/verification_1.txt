Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aimed to increase the visual distinctness of the main navigation links ("Home", "Add Business", "Business Forum", "Testimonials", "Promotion") located in the top section of the page. The suggested method was to apply a "subtle, light box around each one."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, each of the specified main navigation links (Home, Add Business, Business Forum, Testimonials, Promotion) now has a faint, light-colored rectangular background (a "box") around it. This is a noticeable difference from the "before" image where these links were just plain text directly on the page background. The added boxes successfully make the links appear more distinct.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is precisely what was requested: the links are more distinct, and the method used (subtle, light boxes) matches the suggestion perfectly. The change has been applied consistently to all the relevant navigation links.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
