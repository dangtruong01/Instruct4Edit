Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction requested two specific changes for the "Search for" and "near" input fields:
    *   Increase their visual separation (make them stand out more).
    *   Give them a slightly softer, rounded look (apply a subtle border-radius to their corners).

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Visual Separation:** In the "after" image, the borders of the input fields appear negligibly, if at all, more pronounced or separated than in the "before" image. The change is not clearly visible or impactful enough to be considered "more visual separation."
*   **Slightly softer, rounded look:** This change is clearly **not** visible. The corners of both "Search for" and "near" input fields remain sharp and 90-degree in the "after" image, identical to the "before" image. There is no visible rounding whatsoever.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there are significant missing elements. The primary instruction regarding the "slightly softer, rounded look" has not been implemented at all. The visual separation enhancement is also extremely subtle to the point of being imperceptible.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
