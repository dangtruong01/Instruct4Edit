Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aimed to increase the vertical spacing between individual entries within the "Recent searches" list located on the right sidebar. This change was intended to improve readability and overall visual appeal.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, a subtle but discernible increase in vertical space between the "Recent searches" entries is visible in the "after" image. While the change is not dramatic, there is a consistent, slight increase in the line separation compared to the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No significant doubts or ambiguities. The change is precisely applied to the specified element ("Recent searches" list) and in the specified manner (adding vertical space). The instruction used the phrase "a bit more vertical space," and "a bit" has indeed been added, even if it is a very slight increment. The instruction did not quantify "a bit," so the current implementation falls within the scope of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
