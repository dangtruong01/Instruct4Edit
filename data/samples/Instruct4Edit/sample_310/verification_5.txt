Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The right sidebar's width should be reduced on smaller screens. This implies a responsive design change, meaning the sidebar's appearance will change depending on the screen size.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** While the provided images look similar, the test would have to be performed on different screen sizes to verify. Given just these two images, there isn't enough evidence to confirm the instruction was fully applied. It's impossible to know if the sidebar's width changes on smaller screens.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not demonstrably visible in the provided images.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
