Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requests two changes: (1) increase the size of the "Jetzt kontaktieren" button and (2) change its color to something that stands out.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The button "Jetzt kontaktieren" in the "after" image is larger than the one in the "before" image. Its color has also changed to a bright orange, which is very different and stands out compared to the original.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. Both instructions are clearly and fully met.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
