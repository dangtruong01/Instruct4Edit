Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction calls for two changes:
    *   Increase the font size of the main heading "Ihr fachkundiger Ansprechpartner".
    *   Add space below the heading.

2.  **Visibility of Changes:**
    *   The font size of "Ihr fachkundiger Ansprechpartner" appears to be larger in the second image compared to the first.
    *   There is some visual space added beneath the heading.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The changes are visible.

**Final Verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
