Here's a breakdown of the changes:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The navigation bar should change to a solid, darker color and the padding around the navigation items (the text links within the navigation bar) should increase.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible?** Yes, the navigation bar in the "after" image has a solid, darker background color compared to the original image, and the items are now separated with greater spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, all instructions are clearly applied.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
