Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a visual change to the "Posting Lebih Baru" and "Posting Lama" buttons, specifically making them a more visually prominent color. This implies changing the background or text color of the buttons to draw more attention to them.
2. Comparing the two images, the background color of both buttons, "Posting Lebih Baru" and "Posting Lama", has been changed from white to a light green color. This makes them more prominent.
3. There are no doubts or ambiguities. The color change is visible and consistent with the instruction.

Final verdict:
