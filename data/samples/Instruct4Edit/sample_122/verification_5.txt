Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to make the numbers within "pricing text for the hosting services" bigger and bolder to emphasize them.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Upon careful comparison of both the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible "pricing text for hosting services" present in either image. Both images appear to be absolutely identical, showing information about domain renewal steps, but no pricing details or numbers related to hosting services.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the fundamental element that the instruction targets (pricing text with numbers for hosting services) is entirely absent from the provided UI. Since the target element is missing, the requested change cannot be observed or verified as applied.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
