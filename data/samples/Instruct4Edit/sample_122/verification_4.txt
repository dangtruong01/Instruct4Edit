Here's a cautious review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction clearly states two intended changes for the "video player" (the large rectangular box with a border in the "before" image):
    *   Increase its width to fill more available space.
    *   Remove its dark border.
    The implication is that the video player itself should remain present, just resized and restyled.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **"Increase the width of the video player..."**: No. The video player element, which was a large bordered rectangle in the "before" image, is *completely absent* in the "after" image. It has not been increased in width; it has been removed entirely.
    *   **"...and remove its dark border."**: Yes, the dark border is no longer visible. However, this is because the entire element it belonged to has been removed, not because only the border was removed while the player remained.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a major issue. The instruction was to *modify* an existing element (make it wider, remove its border). The "after" image shows that the element itself has been *deleted*. This is a significant deviation from the instruction. The instruction implicitly assumes the video player should still be on the page, just in a modified state. By removing it, the core intent of "increase the width of the video player" cannot be fulfilled.

**Final verdict:**
