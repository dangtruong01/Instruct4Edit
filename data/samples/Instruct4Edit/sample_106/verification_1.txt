Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the navigation bar. While not explicitly visible in the provided images, we're assuming the 'top of content' area functions as the navigation.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernible shadow added to the "Skip to content" text area.
3. The navigation bar and any shadow effect are not visible in either image. Assuming the "Skip to content" area acts as navigation, the shadow is not present in the second image, so the instruction wasn't applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
