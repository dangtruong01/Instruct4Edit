Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the article title and the article content.
2. I observe the space between the title "Chalupy, Piaski, Orzechowo - Jakie miejscowośc..." and the following paragraph "Morze zachwyca o każdej porze roku...". The space is visually unchanged in the after image compared to the before image.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
