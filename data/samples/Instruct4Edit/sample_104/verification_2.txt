Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the horizontal spacing between the content columns to make the page feel less cramped.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no clear visual change in the horizontal spacing between the content columns. The elements in the "after" image appear to be in the same positions as in the "before" image.
3. The spacing between the columns appears identical, so the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
