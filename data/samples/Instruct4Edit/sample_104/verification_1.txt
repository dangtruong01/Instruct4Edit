Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle border radius to be applied to the main table, softening the hard edges.
2. Comparing the two images, it is not visually apparent that any border radius has been applied. The table edges appear just as sharp in the "after" image as in the "before" image.
3. There are no visible changes that suggest a border radius was applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
