Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The background of the main navigation bar needs to be a darker shade. The navigation bar is located at the top of the page.
2.  **Visibility of Change:** The "after" image shows a darker background color on the navigation bar than the "before" image.
3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities/Missing Elements:** I am certain the change is visible and matches the instruction.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
