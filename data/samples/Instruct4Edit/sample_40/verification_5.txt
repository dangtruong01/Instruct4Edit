Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Reduce the amount of text in the company description.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the description of the company appears to be truncated.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
