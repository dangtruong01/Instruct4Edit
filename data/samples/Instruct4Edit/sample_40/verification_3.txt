Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the company item boxes. This means the individual boxes (e.g. the one containing the company name, address, and description in the example) should appear to have a slight shadow around them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The company box has a shadow in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The shadow is clearly visible.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
