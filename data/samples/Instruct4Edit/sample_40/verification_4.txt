Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to increase the size of the headings within the company details. It is not entirely clear which headings the instruction refers to.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** It appears that the heading "Chassis Ernst" has been made larger.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction lacks specific details, and it is difficult to determine the instruction's accuracy.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
