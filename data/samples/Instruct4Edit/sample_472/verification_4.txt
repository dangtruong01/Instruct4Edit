Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the style and size of the "Facebook" heading in the sidebar to match the other headings on the page. This means the font-size and font-weight (boldness) should be consistent with the other headings like "Oldal kiválasztása" or "Gyűjtőjatós történt egy m" etc.
2. Comparing the two images, the "Facebook" heading seems to have had its font-size and possibly boldness adjusted to visually match the other headings.
3. There appears to be no ambiguity, the change is clear.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
