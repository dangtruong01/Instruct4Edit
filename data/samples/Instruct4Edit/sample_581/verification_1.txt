Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the background color of the navigation menu lighter than the header so it is visually distinct.
2. I cannot see a distinct "navigation menu" background color in either the "before" or "after" image.
3. There is no immediately apparent visual change between the two images related to the navigation menu background color. I cannot tell which part of the layout refers to the "navigation menu", so I cannot confirm if it has been changed or not.

Final verdict:
