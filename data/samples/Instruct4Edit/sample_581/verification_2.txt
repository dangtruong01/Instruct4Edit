Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main header. This means the dark area at the very top of the image, containing the text "FREE MP4 MOVIE" and "DOWNLOAD FREE MP4 MOVIES".
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any difference in the header. There is no shadow visible in the "after" image that was not in the "before" image.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction itself, however the subtle nature of the shadow might make it hard to detect.

Final verdict:
