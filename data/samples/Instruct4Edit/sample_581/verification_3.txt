Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the movie title and the movie description. The movie title is "Bad Boys for Life 2020" and the description is the text that begins with "For a long time, service in a site located in the state of Florida...".
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible change in the spacing between the movie title and the movie description.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
