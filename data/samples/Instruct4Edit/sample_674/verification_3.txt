Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a "thin, subtle border around the large image of the artwork." This means a visible outline should be added to the perimeter of the artwork image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of both images, I cannot detect any visual difference in the large artwork image. Specifically, there is no discernable border or outline added around the artwork in the "after" image that was not present in the "before" image. The artwork appears to be integrated into the white background in the exact same manner in both instances, without any added visual boundary.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the instructed border is entirely missing. The "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image concerning the border around the artwork.

**Final verdict:**
