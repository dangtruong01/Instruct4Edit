**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that the artist's name "Stacy Nixon" should be made "noticeably larger" and "thicker" to give it "more presence." This means both the font size and font weight should be increased.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, specifically focusing on the text "Stacy Nixon":
    *   **Larger:** There is no discernible increase in the font size (height or width) of "Stacy Nixon" in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. The text appears to occupy the exact same visual space.
    *   **Thicker:** There is no discernible increase in the font weight (boldness or stroke thickness) of "Stacy Nixon." The characters' lines appear identical in both images.
    *   **More presence:** Since neither size nor thickness has changed, the text does not have "more presence" in the "after" image; it looks exactly the same as in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no doubt. The intended visual change (larger and thicker text) is entirely absent. The "after" image appears to be identical to the "before" image with regard to the "Stacy Nixon" text.
