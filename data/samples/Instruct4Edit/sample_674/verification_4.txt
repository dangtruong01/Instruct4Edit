Here's the review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction "Increase the horizontal space on both the left and right sides of the main content area that holds the text and the image" intends for the central content block (comprising "Stacy Nixon", "Contemporary Fine Art", the "Enter" button, and the large artwork image) to become horizontally narrower or to shift more towards the center, creating more visible empty space (padding/margin) between its edges and the theoretical viewport boundaries.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon meticulous comparison, the entire content block—from the left edge of "Stacy Nixon" and the artwork to the right edge of the artwork—occupies precisely the same horizontal width and position in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in horizontal spacing (margin or padding) on either the left or the right side of this main content area. The content's horizontal alignment and width remain identical.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts. The "after" image is visually identical to the "before" image in terms of the horizontal spacing and positioning of the main content area. The instruction appears to have not been implemented at all.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
