Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific changes for the "Enter" button:
    *   Change its background color to a solid, dark color.
    *   Make its corners significantly more rounded.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Background color:** In the "before" image, the "Enter" button has a light brownish-gold background. In the "after" image, the background color has been changed to a solid black, which is clearly a dark color.
    *   **Rounded corners:** In the "before" image, the button has subtly rounded corners. In the "after" image, the corners are dramatically more rounded, approaching a full capsule or pill shape, which aligns with "much more rounded."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both parts of the instruction ("solid, dark background color" and "corners much more rounded") have been clearly and completely implemented.

Final verdict:
