Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the image carousel (which appears to be the blue rectangular sections) to make it stand out from the background.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot discern any difference, specifically a shadow, around the blue rectangular sections in the modified image.
3. There is no visible shadow added to the carousel in the after image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
