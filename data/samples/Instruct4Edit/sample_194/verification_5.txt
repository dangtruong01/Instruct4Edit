Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the content within the blue footer background to be vertically centered.
2. Comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, the footer content appears to be in the same position vertically in both images. There is no noticeable vertical centering.
3. The footer content is still aligned at the top of the blue background, leaving considerable space at the bottom. It needs to be moved down to the middle of the blue background to be considered vertically centered.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
