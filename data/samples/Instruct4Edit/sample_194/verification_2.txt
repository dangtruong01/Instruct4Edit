Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the navigation menu items' hover effect more modern and visually appealing. This could mean a change in color, a subtle animation, an underline appearing, or a background change.
2. By comparing the "before" and "after" images, there are no visual changes to the navigation menu items on the left side of the image. There is no hover effect visible.
3. There's no evidence of any hover effect being added or modified in the second image.

Final verdict:
