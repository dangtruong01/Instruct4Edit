Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to change the color of the links in the footer to a darker shade, making them less prominent.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the links in the footer are clearly darker in the "after" image. The change is apparent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the implementation is clear and direct.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
