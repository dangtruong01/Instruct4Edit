Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle background color when hovering over the "popular searches" list items. Since it is a hover state, we need to assume the "after" image would show at least one element hovered.
2. Comparing the two images, there's no visual difference. The "after" image doesn't show any list item with a background color. We cannot assume that there are any hover effect from the image itself.
3. The instruction is not visible in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
