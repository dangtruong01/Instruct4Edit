Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies changing the background color of the top strip to light gray.
2. Comparing the two images, the color of the top strip remains a dark color in both images. There is no discernible change in background color to a light gray.
3. The instruction was not implemented as the color of the strip did not change in the modified image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
