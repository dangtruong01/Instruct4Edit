Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the color of the word definition links on the sub-navigation to green, matching the "Relate" color. The sub-navigation refers to the navigation bar containing the words "Define", "Relate", "List", "Discuss", "See", "Hear", "Love".
2. In the before image, the word definition links (Define, List, Discuss, See, Hear, Love) are in blue. In the after image, the same links are still blue, which indicates that the color change to green was not made.
3. The change is not visible in the after image.

Final verdict:
