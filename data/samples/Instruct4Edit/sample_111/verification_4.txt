Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a light gray background to the sections under "Definitions", "Etymologies", "Support" and "Examples". This aims to visually separate those sections from the rest of the content.
2. Comparing the "after" image to the "before" image, there is no light gray background added to any of the mentioned sections.
3. There are no elements of the instruction that have been implemented. The background color in these sections remains white.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
