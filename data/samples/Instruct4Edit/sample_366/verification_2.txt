Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding around the blog post content. This means increasing the space between the content (text, images, etc.) and the edges of the content area.
2. Comparing the two images, it's very difficult to see any significant change in padding. The text appears to be positioned in roughly the same place relative to the surrounding elements.
3. There is no readily apparent change that I can clearly identify.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
