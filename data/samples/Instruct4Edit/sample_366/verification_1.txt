Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to give the navigation bar a background color and to make the text stand out more. By visual inspection, the navigation bar is at the top of the page.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no clear visual change in the navigation bar. There is a faint grey bar at the top of the page that could be interpreted as a background for the navigation bar, but it is very subtle and barely noticeable. The text does not seem to stand out more.
3. Due to the subtle change, it is not clear if the instruction was properly applied. It is ambiguous if the grey bar is the new background color, and it is also ambiguous if the text is supposed to stand out more.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
