Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires adding a subtle border around the sidebar widget to visually separate it from the main content.
2. In the "after" image, there is a subtle grey border around the sidebar widget ("Neueste Beitrage") that is not present in the "before" image. This border visually separates the sidebar from the main content.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The border is visible and consistent with the instruction.

Final verdict:
