Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to style the comment form to match the overall website aesthetic, focusing on the button style. This means the comment form elements (text fields, labels, and the submit button) should have visual characteristics consistent with other similar elements on the page (font, color, borders, spacing, etc.).
2. Comparing the two images, the most obvious change is the "Kommentar absenden" button. In the "before" image, the button has a standard gray appearance. In the "after" image, the button is styled with a blue background and white text. It's difficult to tell if all aspects of the website's aesthetic were fully applied.
3. It is unclear if other changes have been made to the comment form. For example, the font and border style of the text boxes may or may not have been modified.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
