Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The background color of the footer (the section at the very bottom of the image) should change from its original darker gray color to a lighter shade of gray.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the footer's background color is visibly lighter in the second image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** None. The change is clear and complete.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
