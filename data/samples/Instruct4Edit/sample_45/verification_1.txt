Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to make the text of the navigation menu items a slightly darker shade.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the navigation menu text in the "after" image looks the same as in the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not visible.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
