Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the width and height of the "Boka nu" button and the phone number button.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The "Boka nu" button in the "after" image appears to be slightly wider and taller. However, the "phone number" button is hardly visible in the first place, it is not clear if the change was implemented on it.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The changes to the "Boka nu" button can be verified. But it's unclear if the other button was modified, and even if it was, there's no easy way to confirm that it happened.

Final verdict:
