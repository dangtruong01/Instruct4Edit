Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to change the "Leggi l'Estratto" (Read Excerpt) button's shape from its current slightly rounded rectangular form to a more pronounced, fully rounded, "pill-shaped" design. This change should also make it visually "more distinct."

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the "Leggi l'Estratto" button has subtly rounded corners. In the "after" image, the corners of the button are significantly more rounded, creating a distinct "pill" or "stadium" shape. The increased curvature is evident and successfully transforms its appearance.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The button in the "after" image very clearly adopts a pill-shaped design, fulfilling the "pill-shaped" requirement. This new shape also makes it visually more distinct compared to its previous form. The implementation is clear and complete.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
