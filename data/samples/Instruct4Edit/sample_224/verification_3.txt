As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I will assess the provided images against the instruction.

**Instruction:** Make the information banners about product availability and delivery consistent in appearance across all screen sizes.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to ensure that the visual presentation of "Prodotto: disponibile" (Product: available) and "Tempi di consegna 2-3 gg lavorativi" (Delivery times 2-3 working days) remains uniform (e.g., font, size, color, spacing, alignment, layout) when viewed on various screen sizes (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile). This implies a potential responsive design adjustment or ensuring existing responsiveness functions correctly.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is **no discernible visual change** whatsoever to the "Prodotto: disponibile" and "Tempi di consegna 2-3 gg lavorativi" elements. Their font, size, color, and precise positioning relative to each other and the surrounding content are identical in both screenshots.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements. The core of the instruction is "across all screen sizes." However, only a single screen size (viewport) is provided for both the "before" and "after" states. Without views of the UI on different screen sizes (e.g., mobile, tablet), it is impossible to verify if the consistency has been achieved *across all screen sizes*. Since no visual change is apparent even for the single provided screen size, and the crucial "across all screen sizes" aspect cannot be verified, the implementation is not evident from the provided material. The instruction implies a necessary change or a verification of responsive behavior, neither of which is demonstrated here.
