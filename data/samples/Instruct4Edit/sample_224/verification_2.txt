Here's my review:

**Instruction:** Change the background color behind the main product image to a softer, more subtle tone.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to alter the background color directly behind the product image (represented by the grey placeholder box with "Leggi l'estratto") from its current state to a color that is less vibrant and more subdued.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. In both the "before" and "after" images, the background color behind the main product image (the large orange area at the top) remains identical. It is a bright, somewhat reddish-orange in both instances, and has not been changed to a softer or more subtle tone.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the background color in question has clearly not been altered between the two images. The instruction was not implemented.
