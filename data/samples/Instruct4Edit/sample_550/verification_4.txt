Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies increasing the top and bottom padding of the green site title in the header. This aims to create more visual space around the title, preventing it from appearing cramped.
2. By comparing the two images, I cannot see any visually identifiable change in the padding of the site title in the header.
3. I cannot clearly identify the green title. Without being able to find the specified element, I cannot say whether the instruction was fulfilled or not.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
