Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to reduce the spacing between the image and the title in each of the blog post entries.
2. Looking at the before and after images, I can compare the spacing between the images and titles "Waarom titel "narcisme.blog" en niet zelfgenezing?" and "The Secrets of the narcissist". The spacing appears to be very similar, it's hard to ascertain if there is any reduction.
3. Due to the subtle nature of the change, it is difficult to be certain if the change was fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
