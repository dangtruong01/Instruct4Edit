As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images based on the provided instruction.

**Instruction:** Turn the primary navigation links located just below the search input field into visually distinct, uniformly styled buttons.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction targets the links "Portada", "Añadir a web", "Editar tus Datos", "Favoritos", and "Mensaje" which are located immediately below the search input field. The goal is to transform their appearance from standard text links (blue and underlined) into clear, separate, and consistently styled button-like elements. This implies adding a background, potentially a border, and padding to make them visually distinct and clickable.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    *   **Before Image:** The elements "Portada", "Añadir a web", "Editar tus Datos", "Favoritos", and "Mensaje" are presented as plain, blue, underlined text hyperlinks.
    *   **After Image:** These same elements have been transformed into prominent rectangular shapes. They now have a light green background, a darker green border, and appropriate padding around the text, giving them the clear appearance of buttons.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **"Visually distinct":** Yes, they stand out significantly from the surrounding text and their previous link appearance.
    *   **"Uniformly styled":** Yes, all five elements share the exact same styling characteristics (background color, border, text color, padding, and shape), demonstrating uniformity.
    *   **"Buttons":** Yes, they now visually convey interactivity and a clickable area, consistent with common button design patterns.

    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the implementation of this instruction. The modification is precise and complete.
