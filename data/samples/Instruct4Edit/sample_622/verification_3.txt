As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images to assess the implementation of the instruction.

**Instruction:** Add more vertical spacing between each search result entry to improve readability and separation.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the empty vertical space between distinct search result blocks (e.g., the block starting with "Portal de Aurora" and the block starting with "Professor Marduk"). This change is meant to visually separate each search result more clearly, improving readability and scannability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon close inspection and comparison of the vertical spacing between each search result entry in both images, there is no discernible difference. The amount of vertical space (the gap) between entries such as "Portal de Aurora" and "Professor Marduk," or "Professor Marduk" and "Magia Infinita," appears to be identical in both the "before" and "after" images. The layout of the search results area remains unchanged regarding vertical spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the requested change is clearly not present. The vertical spacing between the search result entries is precisely the same in both versions. The instruction was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
