Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests that the current page number in the pagination list (located at the bottom of the page, e.g., `[1][2][3]...`) be made significantly more prominent. This prominence was suggested to be achieved through a bolder color and potentially larger text, with the ultimate goal of making it easy for the user to identify which page they are currently on.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    In the "before" image, all page numbers in the pagination list appear uniform in style, making it difficult to immediately discern which page is the current one (presumably '5' given its position in the sequence and the subsequent change).
    In the "after" image, the number '5' is now visually distinct. It has a solid blue background and darker text (appearing black or a very dark blue), which makes it stand out significantly from the other page numbers that are rendered as light blue links on a white background. This effectively draws the user's eye to the current page.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction suggested "perhaps with a bolder color *and* larger text." While a bolder color (via background and text color contrast) has been effectively applied to make the number prominent, the text size of the number '5' itself does not appear to be noticeably larger than the other page numbers. However, the primary goal of "significantly more prominent" and "easily identify which page the user is on" has been fully met through the strong use of color and background. The "larger text" was presented as a *suggestion* ("perhaps with..."), not a strict, mandatory requirement if prominence could be achieved otherwise.
