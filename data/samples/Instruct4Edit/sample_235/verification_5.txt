Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reduce the overall width of the main content area (title, author info, and body text). This reduction in width should be achieved by increasing the amount of blank space (or margins/padding) on both the left and right sides of this content block.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the main text block, including the title "What does it mean to live "on purpose?"", extends closer to the left and right edges of the screen.
    *   In the "after" image, the entire content block (title, author info, and paragraphs of text) has been made narrower. This is evident by the increased white space on both the left and right sides of the content. The text column itself is visibly more condensed horizontally.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The change is precisely as described: the content area is narrower, and the blank space on both sides has increased. The instruction "slightly narrower" is met as the change is noticeable but not extreme, and "giving more blank space on the left and right sides" is accurately reflected.

Final verdict:
