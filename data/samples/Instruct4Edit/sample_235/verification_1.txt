**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that "main navigation links" (Home, Services, Methods, About, Blog, FAQ, Contact) should "change to a brighter color when you hover your mouse over them." This implies a dynamic visual change that occurs only when the user interacts with the links by placing their mouse cursor over them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. In both images, the main navigation links appear to be in their default, un-hovered state, with the exact same color (dark grey/black). There is no visual evidence in the "after" image that demonstrates the requested hover effect. To verify this instruction, an "after" image would ideally need to show one or more links *in their hovered state* (i.e., with the brighter color applied), or a video demonstrating the interaction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, significant doubt. The instruction describes a dynamic interaction (a hover state), but the provided "after" image is a static snapshot that shows no change from the "before" image in terms of the navigation link colors. Therefore, it's impossible to visually confirm from these two images whether the hover effect has been implemented as requested. The images do not capture the *state* that the instruction specifies.
