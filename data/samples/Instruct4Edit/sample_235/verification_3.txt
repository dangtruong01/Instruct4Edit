**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical white space (line height or margin-bottom/padding-bottom) between the distinct paragraphs within the main article body. This visual separation helps break up large blocks of text, making the content easier to scan and improving overall readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the visual space between paragraphs appears to be identical. For instance, comparing the spacing between the third and fourth paragraphs, or the fourth and fifth paragraphs (and so on, down to the last visible paragraph), there is no discernible increase in the vertical gap. The layout and spacing of the text blocks are identical in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the *lack* of change in the visible areas. A black bar is present in both images, obscuring a section of the text. While this bar prevents a full review of *all* paragraphs in the article body, it is an identical artifact in both images and does not represent an implementation of the instruction. Based on the majority of the article content that *is* visible and comparable, the instruction to increase visual space between paragraphs has not been applied.

**Final verdict:**
