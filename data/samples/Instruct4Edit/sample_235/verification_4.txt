Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to change social media links, which were previously displayed as text, into their respective brand icons (like the Facebook 'f' or Twitter bird) within the footer area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   In the "before" image, there are **no social media links visible in the footer at all**, whether as text or icons.
    *   In the "after" image, **three blank, square outlines have appeared** in the footer, positioned to the right of "Powered by WordPress".
    *   This is not a transformation from "just text" to "icons," as no text links were present in the "before" image's footer. Instead, new, empty placeholders have been *added*.
    *   Furthermore, these are blank outlines, not "their respective brand icons" as specified in the instruction. The actual icons (e.g., the Facebook 'f') are missing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Missing baseline:** The fundamental premise of the instruction, which was to change links from "just text," cannot be verified because no social media links (text or otherwise) are present in the footer of the original "before" image.
    *   **Missing target:** The "after" image only shows placeholder boxes, not the actual "brand icons" requested. The icons themselves are entirely absent.

**Final verdict:**
