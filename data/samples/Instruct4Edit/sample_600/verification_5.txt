Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires increasing the font size and readability of the text at the bottom of the page. I would expect to see the text in the "Archives", "Categories", and "Tag" sections to be larger and more legible.
2. Comparing the two images, the text in those sections appears to be noticeably larger in the second image. It seems like the font size was increased.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clear and consistent with the instruction.

Final verdict:
