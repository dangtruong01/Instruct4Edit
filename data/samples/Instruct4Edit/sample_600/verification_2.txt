Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the vertical padding of the navigation bar. This means the space between the navigation links and the top and bottom borders of the navigation bar should increase.
2. By visually comparing the before and after images, it's difficult to discern any change in the vertical padding of the navigation bar. The navigation links appear to be positioned at the same distance from the top and bottom borders in both images.
3. Without a more precise measurement or a clearer visual difference, it is impossible to confirm the change.

Final verdict:
