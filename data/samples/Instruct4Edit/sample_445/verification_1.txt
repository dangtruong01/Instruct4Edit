Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the margin on the left and right sides of the page. This means the content should be more centered and have more empty space on either side.
2. Visually comparing the images, there is no apparent change in the left and right margins. The content appears to occupy the same width in both images.
3. There are no visible changes to confirm the instruction was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
