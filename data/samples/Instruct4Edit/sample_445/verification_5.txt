Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background gradient of the boxes to be a more modern and softer color transition. This means the boxes in the 'after' image should have a gradient that is visually smoother and uses more contemporary colors than the 'before' image.
2. Visually comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, there appears to be a very subtle, almost imperceptible change to the box backgrounds. It's hard to definitively say if the gradient is "more modern and softer" without knowing the original gradient and the specific qualities that define "modern" in this context. The change is extremely subtle.
3. Because the change is extremely subtle, and its effectiveness is difficult to assess against the rather vague instruction, there's ambiguity.
