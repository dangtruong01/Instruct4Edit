Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the size of the social media icons located in the header.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Examining the images, the social media icons in the header of the "after" image *do not appear* to be significantly larger than in the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There is no visible change.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
