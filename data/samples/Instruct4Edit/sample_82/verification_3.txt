Here's the review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the amount of empty vertical space between distinct paragraphs within the main article content. This would visually separate paragraphs more clearly, making the text appear less dense and potentially improving readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon a careful side-by-side comparison of the main article content in both the "before" and "after" images, the vertical spacing between paragraphs appears to be exactly the same. There is no discernible increase in whitespace that would indicate improved readability or reduced text density as per the instruction. The text blocks and their inter-paragraph spacing are identical in both versions.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction specifies an *increase* in vertical spacing. Visually, no such increase has been implemented. The intended change is entirely missing from the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
