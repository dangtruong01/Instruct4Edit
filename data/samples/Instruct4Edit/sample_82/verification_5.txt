Here is a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the length of the horizontal lines located on both the left and right sides of the "Compartilhe com amigos" text. The goal of this change is to improve the visual balance of that specific section.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the horizontal lines on either side of "Compartilhe com amigos" are quite short. In the "after" image, these lines have been significantly extended, making them much longer and spanning a wider horizontal area, which indeed appears to balance the section better with the elements below it.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The lines have been clearly lengthened as instructed. The visual balancing effect, while subjective, is also achieved as a result of this lengthening, making the section feel more grounded and aligned.

Final verdict:
