As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, here is my analysis:

**Instruction:** Make the main article title significantly larger and bolder to give it more visual weight and presence on the page.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to modify the main article title by increasing its font size ("significantly larger") and its font-weight ("bolder"). The ultimate goal is to enhance its visual prominence, making it stand out and command more attention on the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the main article title ("Caso das joias: para 43%, Bolsonaro não deveria ser preso, mostra pesquisa") appears in a standard font size and weight, blending somewhat with the surrounding text. In the "after" image, the same title is distinctly larger and noticeably bolder, immediately drawing the eye and establishing its hierarchy as a primary heading.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. Both aspects of the instruction—making it "significantly larger" and "bolder"—have been implemented effectively and unambiguously. The title now possesses a clear visual weight and presence that was absent in the original design.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
