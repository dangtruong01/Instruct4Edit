Here's my detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the plain text "Verificar" located within the "Para obter mais informações" section into a visually distinct, clickable button. This button should have a specific background color and slightly rounded corners to indicate its interactive nature.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible.
- In the "before" image, "Verificar" is plain black text.
- In the "after" image, "Verificar" is enclosed within a blue rectangular shape. This shape has a solid blue background, making it stand out significantly. The corners of this blue rectangle are noticeably rounded, not sharp. This visual transformation clearly distinguishes it as a button, suggesting clickability.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No.
- The text "Verificar" is the element that was transformed.
- It is now part of a clear, button-like element.
- It has a distinct background color (blue).
- It has visibly slightly rounded corners.
All aspects of the instruction appear to have been fully implemented.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
