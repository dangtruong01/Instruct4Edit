Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests an increase in the "amount of vertical space between lines of text" (line-height) for two specific text elements:
    *   The "product description" (the paragraph starting with "Vickerman 52 Royal Blue Starburst...").
    *   The "long list of countries" (the extensive paragraph beginning with "The seller is "diverteddesign_123"...").
    The purpose of this change is to "make them easier to read."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Product Description:** In the "after" image, the lines within the product description paragraph are visibly more spread out vertically compared to the "before" image. The increased line-height is distinct.
    *   **Long List of Countries:** The change is even more pronounced and impactful in the "long list of countries." In the "before" image, this text block appears very dense and hard to read due to tight line spacing. In the "after" image, the vertical space between each line of text has been significantly increased, making the text much more legible and less overwhelming.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifically targeted these two text areas for line-height adjustment, and the "after" image clearly demonstrates that this adjustment has been applied to both, fulfilling the stated goal of improving readability.

Final verdict:
