**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aimed to widen the primary content block (the dark teal/green background area containing the product title, image placeholders, and text paragraphs) so that it occupies the full horizontal space of the screen, removing or significantly reducing the empty margins on its left and right sides.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, this change is *not* clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the dark teal/green central content area retains its original width. There are still substantial empty margins on both the left and right sides of this content block in the "after" image, just as there were in the "before" image. The block has not stretched across the entire width of the screen.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was explicit about making the area "stretch across the entire width of the screen," and visually, this has not been implemented. The content block remains a "narrower block."

**Final verdict:**
