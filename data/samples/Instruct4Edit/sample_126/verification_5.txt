Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The intended visual change is to increase the horizontal spacing between the individual text links located at the very bottom of the page (e.g., "Christmas Tree Skirts," "Sitemap," "Contact," "Privacy Policy," "Service Agreement"). The goal is to make them appear more clearly separated and less like a single, continuous line of text.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the space between each of the footer links is significantly wider than in the "before" image. This increased spacing makes each link stand out as a distinct element, rather than blending into a tightly packed row.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was straightforward and the visual change directly and fully addresses it. The links are now clearly separated and no longer appear as one continuous line.

**Final verdict:**
