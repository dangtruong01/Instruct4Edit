Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reposition "floating social media sharing buttons." Specifically, they should be moved from being "stuck to the far left" to "the top right corner of the main product description area."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon careful review of both the "before" and "after" images, no "floating social media sharing buttons" are visible at all. Neither in the "before" state (stuck to the far left or anywhere else) nor in the "after" state (at the top right corner of the main product description area, or anywhere else).

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements. The core subject of the instruction – the "floating social media sharing buttons" – are not present in either image. Without the visual presence of these buttons, it is impossible to verify if they were repositioned, or even if they existed in the first place as implied by the "stuck to the far left" phrase. The instruction cannot be verified as implemented based on the provided visual evidence.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
