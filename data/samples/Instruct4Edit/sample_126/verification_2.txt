Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reformat the section containing product specifications (starting with "Brand: VickermanMPN: QTXC200652...") from a single, continuous line of text into a vertically stacked list where each specification (e.g., "Brand: Vickerman", "MPN: QTXC200652", etc.) occupies its own distinct line.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is very clearly visible. In the "before" image, the product specifications appear as one very long, concatenated line of text. In the "after" image, this same information is now neatly organized with each specification entry ("Brand: ...", "MPN: ...", "Holiday: ...", etc.) presented on its own separate line, forming a proper list structure.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the implementation is unambiguous. All the specifications that were previously on a single line are now correctly displayed on individual lines, fulfilling the instruction completely.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
