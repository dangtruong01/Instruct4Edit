Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation links. The navigation links are at the top of the page ("Home", "Conóceme", "Radio", etc.).
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the navigation links appears to be the same.
3. There is no visible increase in the spacing.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
