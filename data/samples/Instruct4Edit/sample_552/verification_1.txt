Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the main navigation bar at the top of the screen stick to the top even when the user scrolls down the page. This means the navigation bar should remain visible even when the page content below it is scrolled.
2. Comparing the two images, it is impossible to determine if the navigation bar sticks to the top of the screen during scrolling. The images only show a static view of the page. There is no visual indicator to confirm that the navigation bar is now sticky.
3. Because the images are static and do not show the scrolling behavior, it's impossible to tell if the instruction has been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
