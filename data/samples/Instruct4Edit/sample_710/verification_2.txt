Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction calls for improved spacing and visual styling of navigation links. This includes adding a subtle background color or separators to enhance readability and visual appeal. The links being referenced are likely those listed under "Перейти к содержимому раздела".
2. The modified image shows changes to the navigation links. "Вернуться на главную", "Форум", "Правила", "Поиск", "Регистрация", and "Вход" have been modified. The spacing between the links is improved, and subtle background colors have been added.
3. I see no obvious issues.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
