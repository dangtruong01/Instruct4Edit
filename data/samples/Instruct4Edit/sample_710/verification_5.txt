Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction aims to visually emphasize the author's information within a post by adding a border around their avatar and other details. This should help differentiate the author's content from the rest of the post.
2. Upon comparing the images, I don't observe any changes to the author's information section. There is no border or any other visual indicator highlighting the author's details in the second image compared to the first image.
3. The instruction was not implemented in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
