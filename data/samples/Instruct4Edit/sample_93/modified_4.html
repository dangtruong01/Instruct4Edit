This article details the diminished value appraisal of a Ford F150 XLT Supercrew AWD Pickup with 8,630 miles that was involved in a Front collision in Springfield, Missouri that caused $10,801.38 in damage. The vehicle was disabled/towed, had structural damage and no air bag deployment. The claimant hired an independent auto appraiser and made a third-party inherent auto diminished value claim for the vehicle’s loss in value. Once a car is repaired after a collision, it is worth less, often much less depending on the severity of the damage. Regardless of how well the repairer did his job, nobody will pay as much for a previously wrecked car as they would for an identical one that was never in an accident. Presenting a diminished value claim and following it through to a satisfactory conclusion is a daunting task for the average person. Obtaining a comprehensive Diminished Value Report is key.</p><p><center><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>WE DON’T USE FORMULAS, ALGORITHMS, AD COMPARISONS OR OTHER SHORT CUTS</strong></span><br/><span style="color: #0000ff;"><strong>SIX UNBIASED DEALER QUOTES IN EVERY APPRAISAL TO VALIDATE OUR RESEARCH</strong></span><br/><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>TELEPHONE CONSULTATIONS ALWAYS FREE-OF-CHARGE</strong></span></center><br/>
We learned from these examples from sales managers at Ford dealerships in Missouri – One dealer said that they would not be able to keep that with it having frame damage and going to auction could lose in that ballpark of 40% of trade-in value depending on a few factors. Another dealer explained that typically when there’s frame damage, the insurance companies know to total it out. He was very surprised they didn’t because now you’re in a very terrible spot of losing probably half the value of the truck.</p><p>The opinions of six unbiased professional sales managers at recognized Ford dealerships form the basis for the most comprehensive Auto Diminished Value Appraisal available. We obtain several of them to validate the diminished value report prepared by AUTODIMINISHEDVALUE.COM. This is what the car owner will experience in the real world.</p><p>The six dealers providing opinions regarding diminished value were given information specific to this vehicle including year, make, model, mileage, pre-accident condition, color, options, any other pertinent equipment, date of loss as well as the nature of the repaired damages and the manner in which the vehicle was repaired. Dealer opinions are based on personal knowledge and access to auction results. Dealers were advised that this vehicle was properly repaired.</p><p>We contacted several Ford dealers in <a><strong>Missouri</strong></a> to establish how these repairs and the resultant repair history would impact this vehicle’s Fair Market Value (FMV). Dealers were provided with an evaluation of the vehicle’s condition both prior and subsequent to repairs.</p><p>Description of damage: Disabling collision damages to the Front with damage to structural components and no air bag deployment. Repair cost $10,801.38. LKQ (used) and/or aftermarket parts were not utilized in the repair/not factored in to the diminished value.</p><p>The average of six (6) deductions was <strong>40.00%</strong>. This is the percentage of Diminished Value to be taken from the FMV at the time of loss.</p><p>We established that the above captioned vehicle had a Fair Market Value (Average Trade-In Value) of approximately $44,000.00 at the time of loss. The Diminished Value was <strong>$17,600.00</strong></p><p><center><a><strong><b><span style="color: #ff0000;">READ CUSTOMER REVIEWS OF AUTODIMINISHEDVALUE.COM</span></b></strong></a></center><br/><center><a>QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS ABOUT AUTOMOBILE DIMINISHED VALUE</a></center></p><p style="text-align: center;"><a style="display: inline-block; padding: 12px 25px; background-color: #007bff; color: white; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 6px; font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; cursor: pointer; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 20px;">Pay Now - Get Your Report for $275.00</a><br/><strong><i><b>Click on the payment button above to pay by Credit Card or Paypal.
