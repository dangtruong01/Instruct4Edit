Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase the vertical empty space (padding/margin) around the images and between distinct text sections (paragraphs, headings) within the main article content. This is intended to improve the overall readability and visual flow by providing more "breathing room" for elements.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of both images:
*   **Empty space above and below the images:**
    *   For the top image (circuit board): The space above it (from "Diminished Value Claim in Springfield, Missouri") and the space below it (before the first main text paragraph "Each week we report...") appear identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no visible increase in spacing.
    *   For the bottom image (red car): The space above "TOTAL LOSS DISPUTE?", between "TOTAL LOSS DISPUTE?" and the image, and below the image (before "call 772-359-4300") appears identical in both images. No additional space is evident.
*   **Empty space between distinct text sections:**
    *   I have meticulously checked the vertical spacing between all paragraphs, headings, and distinct content blocks throughout the main article body. In every instance, the spacing between these sections in the "after" image is identical to that in the "before" image. There are no added line breaks, increased paragraph margins, or any other visual cues indicating an increase in empty space to create more distinct sections.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there is clear doubt. The core of the instruction is to "add *more* empty space." Visually, no additional empty space has been added anywhere as specified. The spacing and layout of elements appear to be precisely the same in both the "before" and "after" images. The instruction has not been implemented.

**Final verdict:**
