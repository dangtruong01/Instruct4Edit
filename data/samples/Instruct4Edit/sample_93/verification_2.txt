**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requires that the primary navigation links, which were previously hidden (implied to be behind a "Menu" button), should now be directly and permanently visible in the website's header area in the modified design.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, there are no visible navigation links in the top-left header area, only "Skip to content" and the site title.
    *   In the "after" image, four clear navigation links ("Home", "About", "Contact", "Service") have been added and are directly visible in the top-left header area, immediately below "Skip to content". There is no "Menu" button or other interaction required to see these links.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No significant doubts or ambiguities. While the "before" image doesn't explicitly show a "Menu" button, the instruction's core intent was to make the primary navigation links directly visible without requiring a reveal mechanism. This has been fully achieved by introducing the links into the header in an always-visible state.

**Final verdict:**
