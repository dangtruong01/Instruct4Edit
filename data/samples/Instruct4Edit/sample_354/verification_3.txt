Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requests adding a subtle shadow to the main content area to create depth. The main content area would be the central area where the blog post and the image reside.
2. Visually comparing the two images, it's difficult to discern any significant shadow added to the central content area in the "after" image. The background color remains very similar to the "before" image, without any noticeable darkening or shadow effect around the central area.
3. There is no visual evidence of a shadow being applied to the main content area.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
