Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the width of the search input box in the sidebar.
2. Comparing the before and after images, the width of the search input box in the sidebar appears to be the same.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
