Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow effect to the header. The header is the topmost area containing the website title and navigation.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no discernible shadow effect added to the header in the "after" image. The header appears visually identical in both images.
3. There is no ambiguity in the instruction, and the expected change is clearly understandable. However, the change is not visible in the modified image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
