Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the "Related posts" section to have a border and a different background color to visually distinguish it from the rest of the content.
2. Comparing the two images, I can see that the "Related posts" section has a border and a different background color in the second image (modified) compared to the first image (original). The background color is a light gray.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
