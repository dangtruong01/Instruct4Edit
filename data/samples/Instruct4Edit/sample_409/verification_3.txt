Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header. This means there should be a slightly darker area just below the header, giving the illusion of depth.
2. Looking at the two images, I cannot see any discernible shadow being added to the header in the after image.
3. The change is either too subtle to be noticed, or has not been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
