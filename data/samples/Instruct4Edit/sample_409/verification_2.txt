Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the links to a more vibrant blue. This implies that the links in the "after" image should appear a more saturated or brighter shade of blue compared to the links in the "before" image.
2. Looking at both images, it's very difficult to see a difference in the blue color of the links. There might be a slight change, but it's too subtle to be clearly noticeable.
3. The change, if any, is ambiguous and not clearly visible.

Final verdict:
