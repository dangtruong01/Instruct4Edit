Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the widgets in the sidebar. The sidebar appears to be the "Unsere Partner" widget which is at the bottom of the image.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, it doesn't appear that the spacing between the links/widgets in the "Unsere Partner" sidebar has been changed.
3. It may be that the "Unsere Partner" section is not considered the sidebar, but I don't see any other visual elements that could be classified as widgets in a sidebar.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
