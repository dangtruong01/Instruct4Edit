Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color of the comment form to a very light gray. The "comment form" appears to be the section with "Schreibe einen Kommentar" as the title, including the fields for "Kommentar", "Name", "E-Mail", and "Website".
2. Comparing the before and after images, I can see that the background of the comment form section is still white.
3. The change is not visible. The background color of the comment form appears to remain the same between the before and after images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
