Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to center the navigation menu items and increase their size, enhancing visibility. The navigation menu items are the ones at the very top of the page, starting with "Skip to content".
2. In the "after" image, the navigation menu items appear to have the same size and positioning compared to the "before" image. They are not centered nor are they visibly bigger.
3. There are no visible changes to the navigation menu items as requested.

Final verdict:
