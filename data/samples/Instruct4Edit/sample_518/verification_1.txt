Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a gradient background in the main navigation bar, transitioning from dark blue to a slightly lighter blue.
2. Comparing the two images, the navigation bar with elements "Trang Chủ", "Giới Thiệu", "Chuyên Khoa", "Cơ Sở Vật Chất", and "Đội Ngũ Bác Sĩ", and "Liên Hệ" does not appear to have a gradient applied in the "after" image. It is a solid dark blue in both the before and after images.
3. There are no visible signs of a gradient effect in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
