Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to change the text color of the navigation bar (the text at the top, e.g., "⭐ Citrus fruits price inflation since 2022").
2. The text in the navigation bar is the same color in both images.
3. The instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
