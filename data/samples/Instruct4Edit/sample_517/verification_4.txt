Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation links in the header. This means that the horizontal gap between the links "Acasa", "Kinetotrainer & Rehabilitation", "Servicii Oferite", "Blog", and "Contact" should be visually wider in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
2. By visually inspecting the two images, the horizontal spacing between the header navigation links appears to have increased in the "after" image.
3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
