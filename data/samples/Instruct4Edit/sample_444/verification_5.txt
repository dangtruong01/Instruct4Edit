Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to give the input fields of the login form a more modern look, potentially using a subtle border or shadow.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there are no visible changes to the input fields. The input fields for username, password, and the login button all appear identical.
3. There are no visible borders or shadows added to the input fields in the "after" image.
