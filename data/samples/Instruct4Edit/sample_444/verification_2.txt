Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to align the logo vertically within the blue header area. This means the logo should be centered vertically with respect to the top and bottom edges of the blue header.
2. Comparing the two images, the logo appears to be in the same vertical position in both images.
3. There's no visible change in the vertical alignment of the logo.

Final verdict:
