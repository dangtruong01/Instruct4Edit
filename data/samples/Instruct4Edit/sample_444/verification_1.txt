Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies changing the "Sign In" and "Create Account" links in the top right corner into buttons with a more prominent, consistent style. This means visually converting the existing links into button-like elements.
2. Comparing the two images, it is clear that the "Sign In" and "Create Account" links in the top right corner have been changed into green buttons. The buttons are visually more prominent.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The change is clearly visible and seems to follow the instructions.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
