Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation links in the blue bar and to make the active link more visually distinct.
2. By comparing the two images, I can see a slight increase in the spacing between the navigation links ("ScreenwritingU.com Home", "Members", "Forums", "Calendar", "Blogs") in the blue bar. However, the visual distinction of the active link is not apparent. It's unclear which link is considered active, and there's no discernible change in its appearance (e.g., color, underline, bolding).
3. The spacing change is subtle, but noticeable. The "active link" change is ambiguous and not visibly implemented.

Final verdict:
