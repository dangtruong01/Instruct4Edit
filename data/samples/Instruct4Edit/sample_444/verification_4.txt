1. The instruction is to remove extra line breaks above the "Sign In" form. This means the whitespace above the "Enter your sign in name and password" section should be reduced.
2. Comparing the two images, there appears to be no difference in the amount of whitespace above the "Enter your sign in name and password" text.
3. There are no ambiguities.

Final verdict:
