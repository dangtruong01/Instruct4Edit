Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the logo in the main navigation bar clickable, leading to the homepage. Visually, this usually translates to a change in cursor on hover or a visual cue like an underline or color change. However, without interaction, we can't determine if the logo is now clickable.
2. There's no visible change in the logo's appearance in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. There is no visual indication that the logo is clickable.
3. Since there is no cursor hovering in the screenshots, it cannot be determined if there is any hover effect, so the only thing we have to go on is whether there is any indication that the logo is clickable, and there isn't.

Final verdict:
