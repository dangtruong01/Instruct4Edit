Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle background color to alternating rows in the historical values table. This aims to improve readability by visually separating the rows.
2. Comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, it's clear that there is NO background color added to alternating rows in the historical values table in the 'after' image. The table looks identical to the 'before' image in terms of row background.
3. There are no doubts. The instruction was not applied at all.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
