Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the font size and make the month names bold in the year navigation section. The year navigation section contains the month names like "Enero", "Febrero", etc.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, it's not clear if the font size of month names has increased. The text appears very slightly bolder.
3. It's difficult to confirm whether the font size was increased. The boldness seems to be increased slightly, but the change is minimal.

Final verdict:
