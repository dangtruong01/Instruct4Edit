**Step-by-step justification:**
1. The instruction asks to change the menu icon to a darker color in the mobile header. However, the images provided only show the desktop version of the site and there is no menu icon in the header of the desktop version. The instruction cannot be verified with the images provided.
2. There is no menu icon to compare in either image, so the change is not visible.
3. The images do not contain a mobile header or a menu icon, so the instruction cannot be assessed.

**Final verdict:**
