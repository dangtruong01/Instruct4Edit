Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a light gray border to the table to separate rows visually.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any visible changes to the table. No borders have been added.
3. There are no apparent changes to the table, so the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
