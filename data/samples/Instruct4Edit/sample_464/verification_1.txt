Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the navigation menu items. The navigation menu items are "Home", "Technology", "IOS", "Android", "Windows", and "Guides".
2. Comparing the after image with the before image, the spacing between the mentioned navigation menu items is not clearly increased.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction but the change is not applied in the after image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
