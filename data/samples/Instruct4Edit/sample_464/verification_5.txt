Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the color of the footer links slightly lighter.
2. Comparing the before and after images, there are no visually discernible changes to the color of the links in the footer.
3. I don't see any visible change of the footer links color, therefore the change was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
