Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to change the color of primary action buttons to make them more prominent or consistent with branding. Specifically, it mentions examples like "Trailer" and "Stream in HD", implying a change in their background or accent color to something that catches the eye more effectively.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the "Stream in HD" and "Download in HD" buttons have a subdued grey background. In the "after" image, these same buttons have been changed to a bright orange background, which significantly stands out more against the dark background of the page.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
- The instruction mentions "Trailer" as an example of a primary action button. However, no "Trailer" button is present in either the "before" or "after" image. This means that if such a button were to exist elsewhere on the page, its color change cannot be verified from the provided images.
- The phrase "or aligns with the main branding" is subjective as no branding guidelines or examples are provided. However, the first part of the instruction ("stands out more") has been clearly fulfilled by the new orange color.

**Final verdict:**
While the specific example "Trailer" button was not present for verification, the core instruction to change the accent color of the *visible* primary action buttons ("Stream in HD" and "Download in HD") to something that "stands out more" has been fully and clearly implemented.
