Here's my review:

**Instruction:** Add a subtle border or separator between the main movie description and the detailed information below it (genre, actor, director).

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for a visual demarcation (a border or separator) between the large block of movie description text and the subsequent list of movie details (like Genre, Actor, Director, etc.). The key is that it should be "subtle."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "after" image, a very thin, light gray horizontal line has been introduced directly below the main movie description paragraph (ending with "future of the universe.") and before the "Genre: Action, Adventure..." line. This line is completely absent in the "before" image. The line is indeed subtle, fitting the instruction's requirement.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The added element is precisely where instructed, serves the intended purpose of separation, and adheres to the "subtle" characteristic.
