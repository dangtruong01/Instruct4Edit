Here's the detailed comparison and verdict:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction "Give the small, dark tags at the very bottom of the page a more prominent and distinct visual style" implies that the current tags are difficult to see and blend in. The intended change is to make them stand out significantly, be easily identifiable as interactive elements (tags/buttons), and have a unique appearance that separates them from general text. This would typically involve changing their background, text color, potentially adding borders, or using a different font style to increase visibility and perceived importance.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is exceptionally clear and dramatic.
    In the "before" image, the tags ("123MoviesFree moviesFree movies onlineCinema moviesWatch series free series online") at the very bottom of the footer are rendered in dark (appears black or very dark grey) text against an equally dark grey background. This makes them almost entirely invisible and not at all prominent or distinct.
    In the "after" image, these same tags have been transformed into clearly defined, light grey rounded-rectangle buttons with white text. Each tag is now a distinct visual element, separated by space, and stands out prominently against the dark footer background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    None whatsoever. The implementation has gone from an almost unreadable state to a highly visible and distinct style. The new style makes the tags not only prominent but also clearly defined as interactive elements, fulfilling the instruction perfectly.

**Final verdict:**
