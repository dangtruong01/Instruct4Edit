Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Increase the horizontal spacing between the navigation menu items.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The spacing of the navigation items has not changed and is not distinguishable from the original.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction seems clear but no visual change is observable.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
