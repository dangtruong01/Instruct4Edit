Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** Replace the bullet points in the "Artículos Relacionados" (Related Articles) list with numbers.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the bullets have been replaced with a numbered list.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clear.

**Final verdict: ✅ Fully Applied**
