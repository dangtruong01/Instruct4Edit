Here's the breakdown:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction asks to add a bottom margin to the main heading ("Chimenea pellets") to increase the space between the heading and the content that follows.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, there is no discernible difference in the spacing between the heading "Chimenea pellets" and the content below it in either image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is not visually apparent, and therefore the instruction wasn't implemented.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
