Let's analyze the images:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** Increase the size of the logo image in the header.
2.  **Is the change clearly visible?** The images provided do not show a header with a logo. Therefore, it's impossible to assess if the logo size was increased.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change cannot be verified because the element to be changed (the logo in the header) is not present in either image.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
