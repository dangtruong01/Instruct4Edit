**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two specific changes to the "Mrs California America" brand text in the top navigation bar:
    *   Increase its font size.
    *   Make it bolder.
    The overall goal is to make it "more prominent."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size:** In the "after" image, the "Mrs California America" text is noticeably larger than in the "before" image.
    *   **Boldness:** In the "after" image, the "Mrs California America" text is visibly bolder than in the "before" image.
    Both changes contribute to it being more prominent, as instructed.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the changes are clear and directly implement both aspects of the instruction (increased font size and boldness) on the specified text element.

**Final verdict:**
