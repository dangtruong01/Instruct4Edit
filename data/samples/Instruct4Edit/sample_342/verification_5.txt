Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states to move the copyright text (identified as "© 2023" at the very bottom of the page) from its current left-aligned position to a right-aligned position.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, in the "before" image, the text "© 2023" is located at the bottom left corner of the page. In the "after" image, the exact same text "© 2023" has clearly moved to the bottom right corner, demonstrating right-alignment. The change is distinct and easily noticeable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the instruction was very specific, and the visual change perfectly reflects it. The identified text is indeed the copyright text, its initial alignment was left, and its final alignment is unequivocally right. No other elements on the page appear to have been inadvertently affected, and nothing seems to be missing.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
