**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific visual changes:
    *   The main article title, "Overview of improving your looks with clear braces," should be horizontally centered.
    *   Additional vertical space should be introduced directly below this title, effectively increasing the separation between the title and the subsequent date and author details ("September 30, 2020 Giovanni Boccaccio").

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Title Centering:** In the "before" image, the title "Overview of improving your looks with clear braces" is left-aligned. In the "after" image, the exact same title is clearly centered horizontally on the page. This change is distinctly visible.
    *   **Vertical Space:** In the "before" image, the vertical space between the title and the date/author line is minimal. In the "after" image, there is a significant and noticeable increase in this vertical space. The gap between the title and "September 30, 2020 Giovanni Boccaccio" is considerably larger, demonstrating that more vertical space has been added. This change is also distinctly visible.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both parts of the instruction—centering the title and adding more vertical space below it to separate it from the date/author details—have been clearly and unambiguously implemented in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
