Here's my cautious review of the design change:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction has two parts:
*   Increase the line-height ("more air between the lines of text") within the main article's paragraphs.
*   Increase the vertical spacing ("add a bit more space between each full paragraph") between individual paragraphs in the main article.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Line-height (air between lines):** Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the lines of text within the main paragraphs (e.g., "Individuals who utilize metal braces...", "This disdain of the metal braces...", "These can likewise be taken out...") are noticeably more spaced out vertically compared to the "before" image. The text blocks appear less dense.
*   **Paragraph-spacing (space between paragraphs):** Yes, this change is also clearly visible. The vertical gaps between the main text paragraphs (including the space before and after the image placeholder) are distinctly larger in the "after" image, making the separation between distinct paragraphs more pronounced.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, both parts of the instruction are clearly and effectively implemented. The changes contribute directly to improved readability as intended.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
