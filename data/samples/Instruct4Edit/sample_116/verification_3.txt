As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the "before" and "after" images.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies softening the sharp, angular look of main content boxes and other elements by applying "slightly rounded corners." This implies a visible change from 90-degree corners to subtly curved edges on the borders of various UI components.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon meticulous comparison of both images, I observe the following:
    *   **Main content boxes:** The large white container box that holds all the forum content retains its sharp, 90-degree corners in both images.
    *   **Individual post boxes:** Each user's post (e.g., "Ser Sh0ffPuff", "GameMasterZer0", "Regaltiin") is contained within a distinct box. All these boxes have perfectly sharp, angular corners in both the "before" and "after" images.
    *   **Header boxes within posts:** The "Author" and "Message" headers for each post also show sharp, unrounded corners in both versions.
    *   **Navigation elements:** Elements like "MagicEngine Forum Index > General," the top navigation links ("FAQ", "Search", etc.), the search bar, and the "Jump to" dropdown box all maintain their sharp, angular appearance without any visible rounding in the "after" image that wasn't present in the "before" (i.e., no rounding at all).
    *   **Quoted content boxes:** The internal boxes used for quoted text (e.g., "Regaltiin wrote:") also retain their sharp corners.

    In summary, there is no discernible visual difference between the "before" and "after" images regarding the shape of corners on any of the identified elements. All corners remain sharp and angular as they were in the original design.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction for softening the look by adding rounded corners has not been implemented at all. The visual state of the corners in the "after" image is identical to the "before" image.
