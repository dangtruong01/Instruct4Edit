Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to replace old, pixelated image-based buttons, specifically citing "Post" and "Reply," with newer, text-based button designs. These new buttons should also integrate seamlessly with the existing color scheme of the user interface.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** At the top and bottom of the main content area, there are buttons labeled "Post" and "Reply." These buttons are indeed small, have a gradient fill, and show noticeable pixelation, confirming they are image-based.
    *   **After Image:** In the corresponding locations, the "Post" and "Reply" buttons have been replaced. They are now rectangular elements with rounded corners, a solid blue background, and white text. They are clearly text-based buttons, not images.
    *   **Modernity & Color Scheme:** The new button style (solid background, rounded corners, clear text) appears significantly more modern than the previous pixelated images. The blue color used for the buttons is consistent with other blue elements in the forum's UI, such as the "MagicEngine" text in the header, the navigation links (e.g., "MagicEngine Forum Index," "View previous topic"), and some heading elements, indicating it uses the current color scheme.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction specifies "buttons *like* 'Post' and 'Reply'." In the provided images, "Post" and "Reply" are the primary and most prominent examples of small, pixelated image-based buttons that fit this description. All instances of these specific buttons have been updated consistently (top and bottom). There are no other visually similar image-based buttons that appear to have been missed. The change is clear, unambiguous, and appears to cover all relevant elements as implied by the instruction.
