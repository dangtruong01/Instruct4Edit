Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color of the search box in the header to a lighter shade of gray.
2. The search box is visible in both images. By comparing the "before" and "after" images, it is difficult to determine if the shade of gray is lighter in the "after" image. It looks like there might be a change, but it's so subtle that it could also be due to image compression or display differences.
3. There is ambiguity. It is difficult to verify the instruction was completely implemented.
