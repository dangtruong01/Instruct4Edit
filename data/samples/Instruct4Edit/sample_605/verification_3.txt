Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the border of the "Article stats" box in the sidebar less prominent. This would typically involve reducing the line weight or changing the color to a lighter shade.
2. Comparing the two images, the border around the "Article stats" box appears visually identical in both images. The line weight and color appear unchanged.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself. The change, however, is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
