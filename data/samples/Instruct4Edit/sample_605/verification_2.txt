Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the "Sign In / Sign Up" button to be brighter and more inviting, with better contrast against the blue bar.
2. Comparing the two images, the color of the "Sign In / Sign Up" link remains the same. There is no visible change in color or contrast.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
