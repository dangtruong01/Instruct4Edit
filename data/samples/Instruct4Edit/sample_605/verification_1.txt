Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the blue bar at the top taller. This means increasing the vertical height of the blue bar to increase the visual breathing room.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the blue bar does not appear to be taller in the "after" image. The height of the blue bar looks the same in both images.
3. There is no visible change in the height of the blue bar.

Final verdict:
