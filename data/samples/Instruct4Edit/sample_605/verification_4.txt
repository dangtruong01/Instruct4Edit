Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color of the breadcrumbs to a soft gray. The breadcrumbs are located in the light-blue colored section between the horizontal rules just above the "Change Log" section.
2. Comparing the two images, the light-blue background color has NOT been changed to a soft gray. It remains light-blue in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities, the instruction is clear, and no visual change is observed.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
