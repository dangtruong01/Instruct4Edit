Here's the review of the design change:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to increase the horizontal empty space between the left edge of the "main article content" (the large text block on the right, starting with "一、状元办厂创维艰") and the right edge of the "left-hand section menu" (the vertical list on the left, including items like "厂史列室", "大事记"). This would lead to a more noticeable gap, improving visual separation.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is **not clearly visible**. Upon careful comparison of the two images, the horizontal spacing between the left-hand section menu and the main article content appears to be identical. The left alignment of the main article content block, relative to the overall page and the left menu, has not shifted or expanded.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the absence of this specific change. The instruction to "increase the horizontal spacing" has not been implemented visually; the spacing remains exactly the same as in the original image.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
