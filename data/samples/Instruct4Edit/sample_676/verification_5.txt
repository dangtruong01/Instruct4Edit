Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for an optimization of the main article text's readability by adjusting its font size and line height. This implies making the text easier to read, typically by increasing the font size and/or the spacing between lines (line height).

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the changes are clearly visible.
*   **Font Size:** The main article text in the "after" image (starting with "甲午战争后...") is noticeably larger than in the "before" image.
*   **Line Height:** The spacing between the lines of the main article text has also visibly increased in the "after" image, making the text less dense and easier on the eyes.

Both adjustments contribute to improved readability and a more comfortable reading experience as instructed.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction specifically mentioned "font size" and "line height" for the "main article text," and both have been clearly adjusted in a way that enhances readability.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
