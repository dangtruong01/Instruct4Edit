**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to improve the clarity and visibility of options within the main navigation's dropdown menus by changing their backgrounds to solid colors. This implies a change to the visual appearance of these dynamic UI elements (dropdowns) when they are open or active.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In both the "before" and "after" images, only the static main navigation bar is visible. No dropdown menus are displayed or open in either screenshot. Therefore, there is no visual evidence in the provided images to confirm whether the backgrounds of these dropdown menus have been made solid.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant ambiguity. The instruction specifically targets "dropdown menus," which are dynamic elements that typically appear on hover or click. Since neither image shows any active or open dropdown menus, it is impossible to visually verify if their backgrounds have been changed as instructed. The current view only shows the main navigation items in a closed state. To verify this instruction, images demonstrating the dropdown menus in their open state would be required.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (Based on visual evidence; the targeted element is not visible for comparison)
