Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the color of the date displayed below the article title to a muted gray.
2. In the "before" image, the date is a dark gray/black. In the "after" image, the date appears to be the same dark gray/black color. Therefore, the change is not visible.
3. There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction is straightforward and the change is not reflected in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
