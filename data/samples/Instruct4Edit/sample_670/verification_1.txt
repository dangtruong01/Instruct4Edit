Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aimed to increase the font size and visual prominence of the main site title ("Investoras") located in the header section of the website.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. In the "after" image, the text "Investoras" is visibly larger than it is in the "before" image. This increase in size directly contributes to making it more prominent compared to its previous state.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The target element is clearly identifiable, and the change (larger size, increased prominence) is evident and unambiguous.

Final verdict:
