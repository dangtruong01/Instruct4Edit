Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the horizontal negative space separating the main article content from a sidebar positioned on its right.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of both images, there is no visible sidebar positioned to the right of the main article content. The layout appears to be a single-column structure for the main content area, with elements like "Categories," "Leave a Comment," "Recent Posts," and "Recent Comments" appearing below the main article text, not beside it as a distinct sidebar. Therefore, no space increase between the main article content and a right sidebar can be observed or verified, as the latter element is absent.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental missing element: the right sidebar itself. Without a sidebar on the right, the instruction to "slightly increase the space between the main article content and the sidebar on the right" cannot be visually implemented or verified. The premise of the instruction is not met by the current design in either the "before" or "after" image.
