Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to introduce a softer, consistent corner rounding to all elements that visually resemble "box-like containers" within the design. This includes explicit elements like buttons and input fields, as well as broader content areas like the main article body and sidebar sections, if they are rendered within distinct visual boxes. The expectation is that sharp, 90-degree corners should be replaced with a subtle curve.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, no visual change in corner rounding is discernible on any element.
*   The "Menu" button retains its sharp, 90-degree corners.
*   The "Search" input field and button also retain their sharp corners.
*   Other input fields (Comment, Name, Email, Website) maintain their existing unboxed, line-based appearance, with no new bounding boxes or corner rounding applied.
*   The main article content area, "Recent Posts," and "Recent Comments" sections are not enclosed in distinct visual box containers in either image, thus there are no corners to round on these elements as they are currently presented. If the instruction implied creating new boxes around them, that would be a much more significant change, but the current phrasing suggests modifying existing box-like elements.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts about the *lack* of change. The "after" image appears to be identical to the "before" image, indicating that the instruction was not implemented at all. No elements that could be interpreted as "box-like containers" (such as buttons or search inputs) have received any form of corner rounding.

**Final verdict:**
