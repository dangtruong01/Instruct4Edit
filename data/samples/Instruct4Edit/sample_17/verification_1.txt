Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color of the navigation bar to a slightly lighter gray.
2. The navigation bar's background color *appears* to be the same in both images.
3. Because the color change is not perceptible, I cannot confirm the instruction was followed.

Final verdict:
