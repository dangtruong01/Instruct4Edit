As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I must highlight a critical issue:

The second image provided is **not a visual "after" state** of the UI. Instead, it is a textual description of the technical implementation steps taken. To verify the instruction's visual application, I require a screenshot of the modified UI.

Therefore, based on the provided images:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction intended to apply a light gray background and a distinct, fixed-width font to the long text block in the "Symptom" section, visually differentiating it as code.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The "before" image shows the text without these changes. The "after" image provided (the second image) is a block of text explaining the implementation details (e.g., "The `tag containing the multi-line log output has been replaced with a` `tag`") and not a visual representation of the actual UI after the changes. Therefore, I cannot visually confirm if the background color or font style has been applied.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, the crucial "after" UI screenshot is missing. Without it, a visual verification of the design change is impossible.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (Cannot verify visually due to missing 'after' UI image)
