Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing (empty space/padding/margin) directly above and below each main content heading. This change is intended to improve visual separation and create clearer breaks between different sections of content, enhancing readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **"Symptom"**: There is a noticeable increase in space above "Symptom" and a slight increase below it (before the horizontal line).
    *   **"Environment"**: There is a significant increase in space above "Environment" and a clear increase below it (before the bullet points).
    *   **"Keywords"**: There is a significant increase in space above "Keywords" and a clear increase below it (before the text content).
    *   **"About this page"**: There is a significant increase in space above "About this page" and a clear increase below it (before the text content).
    *   **"Search for additional results"**: There is a significant increase in space above "Search for additional results" and a clear increase below it (before the text content).

    All identified main content headings show the intended increase in empty space both above and below them.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was to "add more empty space above and below each main content heading". This has been consistently applied to all relevant headings throughout the document. While the *exact* amount of added space might vary slightly between different headings (e.g., the space above "Symptom" looks slightly less dramatic than above "Environment"), the *intent* of adding *more* space is clearly fulfilled for every heading, creating the desired visual breaks. No headings appear to have been missed, and the change is consistently positive in terms of achieving the stated goal.

**Final verdict:**
