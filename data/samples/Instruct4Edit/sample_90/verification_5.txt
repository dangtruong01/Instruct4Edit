Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to add a "slight circular border" to the social media icons in the footer. The purpose is to make them appear more like "clickable buttons" rather than just images.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No. Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, especially focusing on the social media icons in the "Follow" section of the footer, there is no discernible change. The icons in the "after" image appear identical to those in the "before" image, with no added circular border or any other visual treatment that would make them look more like buttons. They remain just the plain icon shapes.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities: the instruction has simply not been applied visually. The icons look exactly the same in both images.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
