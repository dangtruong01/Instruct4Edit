Here's my review based on your instructions:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for two specific visual changes to the "main title block" at the top of the article:
*   Increase its height.
*   Give its background a darker, more prominent color.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Height Increase:** Yes, the top block containing the title "3385260 - New license was generated but server continues in grace mode - SAP ASE" is visibly taller in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. There is significantly more vertical padding around the text.
*   **Background Color Change:** Yes, the background of this title block, which was white (or the same as the page background) in the "before" image, has been changed to a dark grey/black color in the "after" image. This is a very clear and prominent change.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
None. Both aspects of the instruction — increasing height and applying a darker, more prominent background color — have been clearly and fully implemented.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
