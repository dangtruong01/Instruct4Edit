**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The "Read more" element should be made physically larger.
    *   A noticeable shadow should be added beneath this "Read more" element to provide depth.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Larger "Read more" element:** In the "before" image, "Read more..." is just plain text. In the "after" image, this text is enclosed within a rectangular button shape with significant padding, making its overall visual and interactive area substantially larger than the original text. This part is clearly visible and implemented.
    *   **Noticeable shadow:** Upon close inspection of the "after" image, a very subtle grey shadow is visible directly beneath and slightly to the right of the button. This shadow was not present in the "before" image. While the shadow is quite delicate and not highly prominent, it is discernible and does contribute to giving the button a subtle sense of depth, lifting it slightly from the background. The instruction specified "noticeable," and while it's subtle, it is indeed visible upon careful observation.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There are no doubts about the "larger" aspect.
    *   Regarding the "noticeable shadow," it is present and provides depth. While its intensity is low, it is visually discernible when comparing the two images. The instruction didn't specify the *intensity* of the shadow, only that it should be "noticeable," which it is, even if subtle.

**Final verdict:**
