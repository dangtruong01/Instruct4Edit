Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction aims to increase the vertical space between the heading "プライバシーポリシー" and the content that follows it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. The space above the text "西鹿児島東口開発" in the after image appears to be larger than in the before image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The increase in spacing is clearly visible.

**Final verdict: ✅ Fully Applied**
