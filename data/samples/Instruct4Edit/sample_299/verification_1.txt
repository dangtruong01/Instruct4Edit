Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to change the background color of the main navigation bar to a darker shade of blue.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the navigation bar's background color is noticeably darker in the second image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clearly visible and matches the instruction.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
