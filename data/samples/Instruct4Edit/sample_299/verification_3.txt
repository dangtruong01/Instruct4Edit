Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** A subtle border should be added to the bottom of each menu item in the footer.
2.  **Visibility:** The change *appears* to have been implemented. A dark blue border is clearly added to the bottom of each menu item.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The before image's menu has no bottom borders. The after image clearly shows them.

Final verdict:
