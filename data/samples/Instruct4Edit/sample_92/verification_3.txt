Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two specific changes to the "main article heading":
    *   Increased prominence in size.
    *   A slightly darker color.
    The overall goal is for this heading to "stand out on the page."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, the changes are not visible.
    *   Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernable visual difference in *any* text element on the page.
    *   Assuming the instruction refers to the first line of the article content ("Het Dutch Digital Art Museum Almere is er in geslaagd een nieuw onderkomen te vinden. Dit nadat het eind december moest vertrekken uit gebouw de Voetnoot, tegenover het stadhuis."), its font size and color remain absolutely identical in both images. It is neither larger nor darker.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Ambiguity:** The primary ambiguity lies in the source design itself, as there isn't a clear, distinct "main article heading" element (like an `h1` or `h2` title) explicitly present in either the "before" or "after" images. The content starts directly with the first paragraph.
    *   **Missing elements:** Even if we interpret the first paragraph's opening text as the intended "main article heading," neither the size increase nor the color change has been applied. Visually, the two images are identical in relation to this instruction.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
