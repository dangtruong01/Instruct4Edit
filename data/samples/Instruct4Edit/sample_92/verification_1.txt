Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The main navigation links (e.g., "HOME", "ABOUT US", "DIGITAL ART", etc.) should appear slightly larger.
    *   A clear visual indicator (like a different background color) should be added when a user hovers over these navigation links.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   No, the change is not visible. The "after" image is almost entirely blank, and the main navigation links, along with all other content from the "before" image, are completely missing. The only visible content in the "after" image is the instruction itself, "To make the main navigation links appear slightly larger and add a clear visual indicator on hover, we will add new CSS rules to the existing." This text is an annotation *about* the change, not the visual result of the change.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   Yes, there is a fundamental issue. The "after" image does not display the user interface (UI) elements that were supposed to be modified. It's impossible to verify if the navigation links are larger or if a hover effect has been applied because the links themselves are not present in the image. The "after" image fails to show the modified design.
