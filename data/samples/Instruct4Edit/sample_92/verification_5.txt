Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to replace existing text-based social media mentions located in the footer of the webpage with corresponding recognizable social media icons.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, no text-based social media mentions are visible in the footer section of the "before" image. As there were no text-based mentions to replace, no social media icons have been added or replaced in the "after" image. The footer content (which only includes "Designed by Elegant Themes | Powered by WordPress") remains identical in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the primary doubt is that the prerequisite for the instruction (the presence of "text-based social media mentions in the footer") is not met in the original "before" image. Since these elements do not exist, the instruction cannot be visually confirmed as "applied" in the way it was phrased. There was nothing to replace.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
