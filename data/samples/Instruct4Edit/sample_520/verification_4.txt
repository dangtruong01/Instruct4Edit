Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle box shadow to the main article. This should be visible as a slightly darker outline around the article content, giving the impression that it's "floating" above the background.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot detect any visible box shadow around the main article in the second image. The outline of the article area appears to be identical in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is simply not visible.

Final verdict:
