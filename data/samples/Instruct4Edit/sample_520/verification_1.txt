Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the size of the main navigation links and add more spacing between them.
2. Comparing the two images, the size of the "Fietsen, Golfen, Wellness" links under the menu icon seems to be the same. Also, the spacing between them appears to be the same.
3. I don't see any changes related to the instructions in the provided images.

Final verdict:
