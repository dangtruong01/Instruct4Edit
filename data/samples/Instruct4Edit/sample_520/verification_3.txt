Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a darker shade of gray for the search icons in both the header and the mobile header.
2. Both images show a search icon in the footer, and it appears to be the same shade of gray in both images. I can't identify a header or mobile header in these images.
3. Because I cannot see the header or mobile header and the change is not visible in the footer's search icon, I cannot confirm the instruction was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
