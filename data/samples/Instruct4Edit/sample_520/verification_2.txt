Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the logo in the header and mobile header to have the same font and size. This means comparing the logo "LIMBURG LIMBURG" in the header with the "FIETSEN GOLFEN WELLNESS" displayed in the mobile header.
2. Visually comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font and size of the "LIMBURG LIMBURG" header logo and the "FIETSEN GOLFEN WELLNESS" mobile header remain identical. There is no visible change implemented.
3. There are no visible changes.

Final verdict:
