Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the header background a lighter shade of blue.
2. The header background in the 'after' image appears to be visually the same shade of blue as the 'before' image.
3. There is no visible difference in the shade of blue in the header background.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
