Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main title of the event, which is "Castle Combe – Summer Race Day".
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any noticeable shadow added to the title "Castle Combe – Summer Race Day" in the second image.
3. The shadow might be too subtle to detect, or it might not have been added at all. I am unable to see any visual differences in this element between the two images.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
