Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header. This should create a visual separation between the header and the content below it, making it more prominent.
2. Comparing the two images, it's very difficult to see any added shadow. The header looks practically identical in both images.
3. Due to the subtle nature requested, it is possible the shadow is simply too subtle to easily detect, or does not exist. There is no clear visual change.

Final verdict:
