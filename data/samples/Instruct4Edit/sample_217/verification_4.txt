Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests two specific visual changes to the text of the main navigation menu items:
    *   Make the text *a bit larger*.
    *   Make the text *bolder*.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, focusing specifically on the main navigation menu items ("Home", "Anime", "Desktop Goods", "日本語", "About", "Support us", "minitaku Store"):
    *   **Text size:** There is no discernible difference in the font size of the navigation menu items between the "before" and "after" images. The text appears to be exactly the same size.
    *   **Text boldness:** There is no discernible difference in the font weight (boldness) of the navigation menu items. The text appears to be the same weight in both images, neither larger nor bolder.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The requested changes (larger and bolder text for the main navigation menu items) are clearly not implemented in the "after" image. The navigation menu text remains identical in both size and weight to the "before" image.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
