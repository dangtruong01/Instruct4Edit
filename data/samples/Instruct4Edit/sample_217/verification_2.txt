Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical blank space separating each distinct article entry (title, metadata, and body text) from the one preceding it. This visual separation is intended to make it easier for the user to distinguish individual articles and improve the overall flow and readability of the content on the page. "Generous" implies a noticeable and ample amount of space, not just a subtle increase.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible. In the "before" image, the articles are very tightly packed, with minimal vertical space between the end of one article's content and the start of the next article's title. In the "after" image, a substantial amount of white space has been introduced between the "Player Boyfriend VS Player Girlfriend" article and the "Seiyuu Project" article, and similarly between the "Seiyuu Project" article and the "From Paris to Lavalon~ F7 with love~" article. This added space effectively separates the entries.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was straightforward, and the implementation directly addresses it. The spacing added is indeed "generous" and consistently applied between the visible article entries, successfully improving their visual distinction and, consequently, readability. No other unintended changes or missing elements are observed.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
