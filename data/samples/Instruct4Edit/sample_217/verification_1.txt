**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The instruction intended to *reduce the size* of the existing "main website logo" in the header.
    *   It also intended to ensure the navigation links were *nicely aligned beside* this (presumably smaller) logo.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Logo Size Reduction:** In the "before" image, the header primarily displays text such as "minotauro@sakuraindex.jp" and "sakuraindex.jp" in a small, default font, which are the only identifiable brand elements that could be considered a "logo." In the "after" image, this is completely replaced by a new, distinct, graphical "SakuraIndex" logo with a blue square element. This new graphical logo is significantly *larger* and more visually prominent than any of the text-based branding in the original header. Therefore, the instruction to "reduce the size of the main website logo" was not followed; instead, a new, larger, and graphically distinct logo was introduced.
    *   **Navigation Links Alignment:** The navigation links (Home, Anime, Desktop Goods, etc.) are indeed positioned beside the *newly introduced* logo. Their horizontal and vertical alignment relative to the new logo appears visually acceptable. However, this aspect's success is dependent on the first part of the instruction being correctly applied.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   **Primary Contradiction:** The most significant issue is the direct contradiction of the instruction regarding the logo size. The instruction was to "reduce the size," but the "after" image shows a logo that is clearly much larger and a completely different design than anything present in the "before" image header. This is a fundamental change, not a reduction.
    *   **"Main website logo" interpretation:** While the "before" image doesn't have a distinct *graphical* logo, the text "sakuraindex.jp" serves as the primary identifier. If this was to be reduced, it failed. Instead, a new, larger graphic was introduced.

**Final verdict:**
