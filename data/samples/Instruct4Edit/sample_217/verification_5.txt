Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requested that the corners of the main images within each article preview be given a "gentle rounding." This means the sharp 90-degree corners should be slightly softened to a curve.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the corners of all main images (the large image of two anime characters and the large image of the single anime character) appear to remain perfectly sharp and 90-degree in both versions. There is no discernible visual difference or application of any rounding in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction was not implemented visually. The images in the "after" state retain the exact same sharp corners as in the "before" state.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
