Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to remove the borders from all tables. This means any lines defining the table structure should be absent in the "after" image.
2. Comparing the images, it's clear that the borders around the tables, particularly visible in the "before" image around the login form, the vBulletin Message section, and forum jump section, are no longer present in the "after" image.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
