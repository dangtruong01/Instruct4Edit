Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the header images responsive, meaning they should scale down proportionally on smaller screens. This means that if the screen size is reduced, the header images should also decrease in size to maintain their aspect ratio and fit within the screen.
2. Comparing the two images, I don't see any visible changes to indicate the header images are now responsive. The images appear to be the same size in both versions. I would expect to see a change in the size of the header images, specifically that they scale down when the screen is smaller.
3. There are no visible indicators that the header images are now responsive. The size and positioning of the images in both versions appear identical.

Final verdict:
