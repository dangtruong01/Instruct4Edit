Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add padding around the text inside the "vBulletin Message" boxes. This means increasing the space between the text content and the borders of the box.
2. I examined the before and after images, and I can't find any noticeable changes in padding. The text still appears to be right up against the edges of the boxes.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instructions, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
