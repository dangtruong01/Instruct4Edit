Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the font of the entire website to a more modern and readable font such as Open Sans or Roboto.
2. Comparing the images, there's no visually noticeable change in the font used anywhere on the page. The font in the "after" image appears to be identical to the "before" image.
3. The changes are not ambiguous. The instruction was clear, but the application wasn't successful.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
