Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the list of questions within the "About Us" description more prominent. This was to be achieved by either making their text *bolder* or applying a *slightly different shade* to them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the bulleted list of questions in the "before" image with the "after" image, there is no discernible visual difference. The text of the questions ("知産去綠一個網站？", "網站賺錢是什麼的一回事？", etc.) maintains the exact same font weight and color in both images. It is neither bolder nor a different shade.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The specified visual change (bolder text or different shade) is completely absent from the "after" image. The list of questions looks identical in both the original and the modified versions.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
