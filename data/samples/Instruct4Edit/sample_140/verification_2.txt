Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Replace the blank placeholder image in the bottom section of the page with the main website logo, ensuring it looks good on the dark background.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to introduce the main website logo into the bottom-left corner of the page, where a blank placeholder currently exists. A crucial part of the instruction is that the logo should be visually effective and "look good on the dark background," implying good contrast and readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** In the bottom-left corner, there's a very faint, almost imperceptible square outline. This appears to be the "blank placeholder image."
    *   **After Image:** The faint outline is gone. In its place, there is a solid, dark grey/black square.
    *   **Visibility of the "logo":** While *something* has replaced the placeholder, what is visible is merely a dark square. It does not visually resemble a typical "main website logo" (e.g., an icon, a wordmark, or a combination). It's just a solid block.
    *   **"Looks good on the dark background":** The page background is white. The copyright text next to the "logo" is a dark grey/black. The "logo" itself is also a dark grey/black square. This creates extremely poor contrast for the "logo" against the dark text, making it virtually indistinguishable and not visually appealing or effective. If "dark background" refers to the logo needing to appear well against any potential dark elements (like the text), it fails. If it implies a dark background *should* have been added around the logo, that is also missing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and ambiguities:
    *   **Is it a logo?** The object that replaced the placeholder is a plain dark square. It's not clear if this is genuinely the "main website logo" or if the logo is missing/obfuscated. A logo typically has distinct visual characteristics.
    *   **"Looks good on the dark background":** This part of the instruction is clearly not met. The dark square on a white background with dark text surrounding it offers no visual appeal or effective contrast. It's practically invisible as a distinct element. The instruction's intent for the logo to be clearly visible and integrated well is entirely missed.
