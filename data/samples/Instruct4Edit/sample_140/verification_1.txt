As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I must assess if the instruction is **visually evident** in the provided static images.

**Instruction:** When someone points their mouse over the main navigation words at the very top of the page, make them subtly change color or get a slight underline to show they are interactive.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction describes a *dynamic hover effect*. This means the main navigation words (關於我們, 個人成長, 網站發展, 網路推廣, 軟體推薦) located at the top right of the page should visually react (e.g., change color or gain an underline) *only when a user's mouse pointer is positioned over them*.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. They capture a single moment in time and do not depict interactive states or user mouse actions. Therefore, it is impossible to visually observe a hover effect from these images. There is no discernible difference in the appearance of the navigation words between the two static images; they look identical in terms of font, color, and styling.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental limitation. The instruction pertains to an interactive state (a hover effect), which by definition is dynamic and only occurs under user interaction. Static images cannot display such dynamic behaviors. To verify this instruction, a video recording, an animated GIF, or a series of screenshots showing the mouse pointer hovering over each element would be required. Based solely on the provided static visual evidence, the instructed change cannot be confirmed as applied.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
*(Reasoning: The instruction describes a dynamic hover effect which cannot be verified with the provided static images. Visually, no change is apparent in the navigation elements between the before and after states in the static context.)*
