**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing (or "air") between individual paragraphs within the main "About Us" text content. The goal is to improve readability by visually separating the blocks of text more clearly.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is a noticeable and consistent increase in the vertical white space between each paragraph of text in the main content area. This applies to all paragraphs, from the opening "嗨囉，我是站長破璃陳！" down to the closing "破璃陳". The text blocks now appear more distinct and less dense, fulfilling the "add a bit more air" aspect of the instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The change has been uniformly applied to all paragraphs within the main "About Us" content. No paragraphs appear to have been missed, and the amount of added space seems appropriate for the instruction's intent ("a bit more").

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
