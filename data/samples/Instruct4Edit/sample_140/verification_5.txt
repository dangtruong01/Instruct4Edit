Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to make the names of specific services ("CLOUDWAYS", "CLOUDFLARE", and "WORDPRESS") in the "very bottom text of the page" stand out more, either by making them a brighter white or adding a subtle highlight.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of both the "before" and "after" images, the specific service names "CLOUDWAYS", "CLOUDFLARE", and "WORDPRESS" are **not present** anywhere in the "very bottom text of the page" (which includes the footer links and the last paragraphs of the main content). Since the targeted elements are absent, no visual change related to them could have occurred or be observed.
    Furthermore, examining the *actual* text and links present in the very bottom section (i.e., the footer links like "好物推薦", "關於我們", etc.), there is **no discernible visual difference** in their color, brightness, or highlight between the "before" and "after" images. They appear to remain the exact same light grey color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a critical missing element: the very words ("CLOUDWAYS", "CLOUDFLARE", "WORDPRESS") that the instruction specifically targets are not present in the designated area of either image. This makes the instruction impossible to apply as written to the existing content. No related visual change has occurred in the general area either.

Final verdict:
- ❌ Not Applied
