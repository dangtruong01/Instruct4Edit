Here is the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to increase the vertical spacing between the top-most grey rectangular area (identified as the "website logo area") and the text "Manuales" (identified as the primary navigational element or the start of the "main navigation bar"). This means the "Manuales" text and all content below it should be visibly pushed further down, creating more white space immediately below the grey logo area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close comparison of both images, the vertical distance between the bottom edge of the top grey rectangular area and the top edge of the "Manuales" text appears to be exactly the same in the "after" image as it was in the "before" image. The entire content block, including "Manuales" and everything below it, seems to maintain its original vertical position relative to the grey logo area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There is no ambiguity in the visual comparison. The spacing in question has not been altered. Even if "main navigation bar" were interpreted more broadly to mean the entire content area, the relationship between the top logo area and the start of the content remains unchanged.

**Final verdict:**
