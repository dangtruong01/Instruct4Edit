Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the "Descarga el Archivo" text from a standard link into a more prominent, button-like element. This implies changes in its appearance such as adding a background color, possibly padding, and potentially changing the text color, to make it visually distinct and immediately identifiable as an interactive, clickable action.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible.
*   **Before Image:** The "Descarga el Archivo" is a blue, underlined text link, consistent with other hyperlinks on the page.
*   **After Image:** The "Descarga el Archivo" text is now presented within a solid blue rectangular box with white text. It has clear padding around the text and no longer has an underline. This new appearance strongly resembles a button.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities. The link has been successfully transformed into a visually distinct element that clearly resembles a button, standing out much more than its previous form. It fulfills both aspects of the instruction: "visually stand out more" and "like a distinct button."

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
