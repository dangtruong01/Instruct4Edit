Here's my review:

**Instruction:** Add more vertical space below the main page title, "Suzuki Jimny Manual de mecánica."

**Step-by-step justification:**
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to increase the white space between the main page title "Suzuki Jimny Manual de mecánica" and the paragraph of text directly below it, which starts with "Manual de mecánica Suzuki Jimny. El manual muestra...".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the vertical space between the main page title "Suzuki Jimny Manual de mecánica" and the subsequent paragraph is visibly larger in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is clearly implemented as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
