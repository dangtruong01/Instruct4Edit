Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states to "Center the copyright notice text at the very bottom of the page." This means the text "2023 © Cars 05 Manuales de mecánica" located within the blue footer bar should be horizontally aligned to the center of the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    In the "before" image, the copyright notice text "2023 © Cars 05 Manuales de mecánica" is clearly left-aligned within the blue footer. In the "after" image, the same text has moved horizontally and is now visibly centered within the blue footer bar, covering the full width of the page content area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The text has clearly shifted from left-aligned to horizontally centered. The change is precise and unambiguous.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
