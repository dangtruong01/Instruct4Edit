**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to change the background color of "the long blue bar that contains the navigation links" to a darker shade of blue.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the two images, there are two distinct "long blue bars" in the "before" image:
    *   **Top Bar (Header):** In the "before" image, there is a blue bar at the very top of the page, above the "Manuales" title. In the "after" image, this blue bar is no longer present; the background in that area has become white. This is a complete removal or change to a different color, not a change to a "darker shade of blue".
    *   **Bottom Bar (Footer):** In the "before" image, there is a blue bar at the very bottom of the page containing copyright information and a "Manuales" link. In the "after" image, this bar remains blue, but its shade is visibly darker than in the "before" image. This change aligns with the instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts and missing elements.
    *   The instruction refers to "the long blue bar" (singular), but there are two such bars in the "before" image.
    *   While the bottom bar's color change correctly implements the instruction by becoming a darker shade of blue, the top bar's color was changed from blue to white. Changing to white is fundamentally different from changing to a "darker shade" of blue. This means that if the instruction was intended for the top bar, it was not applied correctly. If it was intended for both (though worded singularly), it failed for the top bar. As a cautious reviewer, any element that fits the description in the "before" state and is not updated according to the instruction signifies incomplete implementation. The instruction was not fully applied across all plausible interpretations of "the long blue bar".

**Final verdict:**
