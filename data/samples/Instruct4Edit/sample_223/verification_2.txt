Here's the review of the UI/UX changes:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction mandates two main visual changes for the navigation links at the top:
    *   Consolidate all navigation links into a single, cohesive horizontal row, eliminating the current two-row layout.
    *   Give the navigation a more modern appearance, specifically suggesting the removal of the small icons that currently precede each link.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Single, cohesive row:** In the "before" image, the navigation links are split across two lines (e.g., "FAQ" to "Registrace" on the first line, "Profil" to "Přihlášení" on the second). In the "after" image, all links ("FAQ", "Hledat", "Seznam uživatelů", "Uživatelské skupiny", "Registrace", "Profil", "Soukromé zprávy", "Přihlášení") are now arranged horizontally on a single line. This change is clearly visible.
    *   **Remove small icons / more modern look:** In the "before" image, each navigation link has a small icon next to it (e.g., a question mark for "FAQ", a magnifying glass for "Hledat"). In the "after" image, all these small icons have been removed. This contributes significantly to a cleaner and undeniably more modern aesthetic compared to the original, fulfilling the "more modern look" aspect of the instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was clear about the two core changes, and both have been visibly and precisely implemented. The consolidation to a single row is complete, and all specified icons have been removed. The resulting design is indeed more cohesive and modern as requested.

**Final verdict:**
