Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks for all interactive elements, specifically mentioning buttons and dropdown menus, to have their sharp corners replaced with a softer, slightly rounded appearance. This implies applying a `border-radius` to these elements to make their corners less angular.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Dropdown Menu:** The dropdown menu labeled "Zvolte fórum" at the bottom of the page in the "before" image clearly has sharp, 90-degree corners. In the "after" image, this same dropdown menu still exhibits sharp, 90-degree corners. There is no visible rounding applied.
*   **Input Fields:** The two small input fields next to the dropdown menu also have sharp corners in the "before" image. In the "after" image, their corners remain sharp and unrounded.
*   **Buttons:** No distinct button elements (like rectangular shapes with backgrounds) are present in either image that could have been rounded. Interactive elements in the header (e.g., "FAQ", "Hledat") are text links and do not have the kind of visual boundaries that would typically be subject to corner rounding.

Based on this comparison, the intended rounding of corners on interactive elements (specifically the visible dropdown menu and input fields) is not visible.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no ambiguities. The elements that *should* have been visually affected by this instruction (the dropdown and input fields) clearly show no change in their corner styling. The instruction was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
