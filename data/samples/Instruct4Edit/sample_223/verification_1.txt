Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The primary intended visual change is to increase the amount of empty space (margins/padding) around the main content area, specifically from the left and right edges of the page. This is meant to give the content "more breathing room" and make it feel less constrained.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is very clearly visible. In the "before" image, the main content area (the large gray box) spans almost the entire width of the page, leaving very minimal empty space on the sides. In the "after" image, the main content area is noticeably narrower and centrally aligned, resulting in significantly increased white space (margins) on both the left and right sides of the content.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    A potential ambiguity lies in the opening phrase "Expand the main content area slightly." When interpreted literally, "expand" might suggest making the content box itself wider. However, the implementation has made the content box *narrower* relative to the page width (e.g., from 100% to 95%).
    Despite this, the subsequent and more specific parts of the instruction – "give it more breathing room from the edges of the page, perhaps by adding more empty space around it" – have been fully and clearly achieved. The chosen method (reducing the content block's width and centering it) is a common and effective way to create this "breathing room" and "empty space" around the content, making it feel less cramped. The overall *effect* is indeed one of more visual comfort and less confinement for the content. The explanatory text at the top of the "after" image further clarifies that the designer's interpretation aligns with achieving this breathing room by adjusting the width and centering.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
