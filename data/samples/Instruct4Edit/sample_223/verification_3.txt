Here is the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to change the "bright blue" accent color (used notably in the section headers like "Obsah fóra mobilecity.cz" and "Informace o uživateli: jan232", and for certain links) to a different, more muted or contemporary shade. The goal was to give the page a "fresher feel."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. Upon close comparison of both images, the specific bright blue color used for the main accent elements (header backgrounds and text links) remains precisely the same. There is no discernible difference in the hue, saturation, or brightness of this color between the "before" and "after" images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the specified color change has simply not occurred. The main accent color appears to be identical in both images, meaning the instruction was not implemented.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
