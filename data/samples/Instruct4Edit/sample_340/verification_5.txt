Here is the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to decrease the vertical spacing between the main site title "Salesalato" and its tagline "Apologetica a fumetti," bringing them closer together.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is visible. Upon close comparison, the tagline "Apologetica a fumetti" in the "after" image has been shifted upwards, clearly reducing the vertical space between it and the "Salesalato" title above it. The change is subtle but distinct.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No doubts or ambiguities. The specific elements targeted by the instruction ("Salesalato" and "Apologetica a fumetti") are clearly identified, and the intended action (reducing vertical space) has been visibly implemented. The term "a bit closer" is subjective, but the action of moving them closer has been executed.

**Final verdict:**
