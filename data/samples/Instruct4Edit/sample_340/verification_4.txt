Here's my detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the list of plain text tags under "Persone che ho nominato..." into visually distinct elements that resemble buttons or badges. This involves two key visual changes for each individual tag:
    a. Applying a soft background color.
    b. Increasing the spacing (padding within the element and margin around it) to make them stand out.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the changes are clearly visible:
    *   **Soft background color:** In the "after" image, each individual tag (e.g., "Agostino d'Ippona", "Albert Einstein", "André Louf") now has a distinct light grey background color, whereas in the "before" image, they were plain text on the white page background. This color is indeed "soft."
    *   **More spacing around them:** In the "after" image, there is noticeable internal padding around the text within each colored background box, and also increased external margin between the boxes themselves. This makes each tag appear as a separate, distinct element, unlike the tightly packed text in the "before" image.
    *   **Look like distinct buttons or badges:** The combination of the background color and increased spacing successfully makes the tags resemble distinct buttons or badges, fulfilling this part of the instruction.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Based on a purely visual comparison and the provided instruction, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. The instruction was precise ("soft background color," "more spacing," "distinct buttons or badges") and the visual outcome clearly reflects all these aspects.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
