Here's my analysis as a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction states that the social media icons in the header should display their names next to them, instead of just the icon. This implies a transition from an icon-only representation to a clearer icon-and-text representation, particularly on larger screens.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** In the header, below "Apologetica a fumetti", there are 5 generic gray squares. These appear to be placeholders or very abstract representations, not clearly identifiable social media icons. They have no accompanying text.
*   **After Image:** These 5 generic gray squares have been replaced by clearly labeled buttons: "Spotify", "Facebook", "Instagram", "Telegram", and "Email". The "Instagram" button also features a red square, which might be an attempt at an icon. This change is very clearly visible and provides the names for the respective services.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
While the names are now clearly displayed (which is the most crucial part of the instruction), there's a nuance regarding the phrase "next to them instead of just the icon."
*   In the "before" image, the elements were generic gray squares, not distinct social media *icons*. Therefore, it's difficult to interpret what "the icon" truly referred to.
*   In the "after" image, for "Spotify," "Facebook," "Telegram," and "Email," only the name is displayed. There is no accompanying, recognizable social media icon *next to* the name. For "Instagram," there's a red square *within* the button, but it's not the standard Instagram icon, and it's not truly "next to" the name in a side-by-side fashion.
*   The instruction implies a desired state where *both* the icon and the name are present. While the names are now clearly visible, the recognizable social media *icons* are largely absent or generic, meaning the "next to them [the icons]" part is not literally fulfilled for most elements.

Despite this, the primary intent of making the social media elements identifiable by their *names* (instead of ambiguous visuals) has been successfully achieved. Given that the original "icons" were not distinct to begin with, replacing them with clear text labels significantly improves usability and clarity, which is the core objective of such a UI/UX change. The spirit of the instruction (displaying names) is fully met, even if the exact visual composition (icon + name) is not consistently applied across all elements.
