As a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the two images provided.

**Instruction:** Add a subtle shadow effect around the blog post summaries to make them stand out more from the page background.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for a "subtle shadow effect" to be added specifically around the "blog post summaries." In this context, the blog post summary is the white rectangular box containing the text "A che servono l'etica e la morale?" and "Autunno 2023". The purpose of this shadow is to make the box "stand out more from the page background."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon very close inspection and direct comparison of the "before" and "after" images, a extremely faint shadow is discernible around the white blog post summary box in the "after" image. This shadow is most noticeable along the bottom and right edges of the box, appearing as a very slight, almost pixel-thin grey haze extending outwards. In the "before" image, this shadow is entirely absent, and the white box merges directly into the light grey background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The primary point of consideration is the degree of "subtlety." While a shadow *has* been added, it is so subtle that it requires significant scrutiny to detect. However, the instruction explicitly requested a *subtle* shadow. The change is not missing; it is visually present, albeit at the absolute threshold of perception. It does achieve the goal of making the element stand out *more* than before, even if by a minimal margin. There are no ambiguities regarding *where* the change should be applied, and it has been applied to the correct element.
