Here's the comparison and justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction specifies that when a user *hovers* over any main navigation item (e.g., "ACCUEIL", "PRÉSENTATION"), it should display a subtle highlight or a slight animation. This is an interactive state change, not a static design change to the default state.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
No. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. The "after" image shows the main navigation items in precisely the same default visual state as the "before" image. There is no visual difference whatsoever in the appearance of the navigation items themselves. For this instruction to be visually confirmed, the "after" image would need to either show one of the navigation items in its "hovered" state (to demonstrate the highlight/animation) or be a dynamic visual (like a GIF or video) if the animation is too subtle for a single frame.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there are significant doubts. The core of the instruction is about an *interactive effect* (hover). A static "after" image cannot fully demonstrate this interaction unless it explicitly shows one of the elements *in* that hovered state. Since the "after" image is identical to the "before" image regarding the main navigation's appearance, there is no visual evidence provided that the hover effect was implemented or modified.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
