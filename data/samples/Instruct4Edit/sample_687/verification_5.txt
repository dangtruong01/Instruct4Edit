Here's the detailed justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the titles of the right sidebar sections (e.g., "Articles les plus consultés," "Libellés") visually stand out more. This prominence was suggested to be achieved by using a different background color or a stronger visual separation. The goal is a "more prominent and modern look."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the section titles ("ARTICLES LES PLUS CONSULTÉS" and "LIBELLÉS") have a white background with a thin black border and a horizontal line beneath them. The text is black.
    *   In the "after" image, these same section titles now have a solid dark grey background, and the text color has changed to white. This immediately provides a strong visual separation from the content below and the surrounding white background. The previous thin border and line are replaced by this solid block.

    This change effectively makes the titles more prominent and gives them a distinct visual weight.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The implemented change directly addresses both suggested methods ("different background color" and "stronger visual separation") by applying a solid dark background color, which inherently provides a stronger visual separation and makes the titles more prominent. The "modern look" aspect is subjective, but the use of a solid background block for headers is a common contemporary design element. All relevant titles in the sidebar have been consistently updated.

**Final verdict:**
