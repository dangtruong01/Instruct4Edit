*   **1. What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the text links "Article plus récent" and "Article plus ancien" into visually distinct, pressable buttons. This implies adding a background color and padding around the text to make them stand out from regular text links and appear clickable.

*   **2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, "Article plus récent" and "Article plus ancien" are plain text links. In the "after" image, both have been enclosed within dark gray rectangular shapes with white text, clearly demonstrating the addition of a background color and significant padding. They now visually resemble buttons.

*   **3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No doubts or ambiguities. The suggested elements (background color, padding) were implemented, and the result is a clear transformation into distinct, pressable buttons as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
