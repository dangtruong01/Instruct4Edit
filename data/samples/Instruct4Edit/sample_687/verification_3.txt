Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Widen the main content area and the sidebar slightly to fill more of the screen, providing more space for the articles and related information.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the horizontal dimension of two primary layout sections: the "main content area" (which contains the article details, video, and comments) and the "sidebar" (which lists related articles and links). This widening should be "slight" and result in these areas occupying a larger proportion of the overall screen width, thereby reducing the surrounding white space and providing more internal space for their respective contents.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Main content area:** Yes, the main content area is visibly wider in the "after" image. The embedded YouTube video player is noticeably larger, and the text blocks (e.g., "Pour écouter l'introduction...") and the comments section below it now span a greater horizontal distance. The left margin of the main content area has also been reduced, shifting it further to the left.
    *   **Sidebar:** Yes, the sidebar is also visibly wider. The content within it, such as the titles under "ARTICLES LES PLUS CONSULTÉS" and the links under "LIENS", now has more horizontal space before wrapping, indicating the column itself has expanded. The right margin of the sidebar has been reduced, shifting it further to the right.
    *   **Filling more of the screen:** As a result of both sections widening and the reduction of the left and right margins of the overall content block, the entire content area (main content + sidebar) occupies significantly more horizontal space on the screen, effectively "filling more of the screen" as instructed. The change appears to be "slight" in that it's a measured increase, not a full-width expansion.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There are no doubts regarding the implementation of the widening instruction for both the main content area and the sidebar. The visual evidence clearly shows both areas have been expanded horizontally, and the overall content block uses more of the screen width.
    *   The instruction's intent to "provide more space for the articles and related information" is also met, as the increased width allows for longer text lines and a larger video player.
    *   A tangential observation: The search bar at the very top right of the header present in the "before" image is missing in the "after" image. However, this change was not part of the specific instruction given to widen the main content area and sidebar, and it does not impede the verification of the instructed change. My focus is solely on whether the *given instruction* was *fully and clearly implemented*.
