Step-by-step justification:

1.  What is the intended visual change?
    The instruction asks to reduce the padding around the main content articles. Visually, this would mean the content would be closer to the edges/boundaries of the article containers or sections.

2.  Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?
    No, the padding reduction is not obviously visible. All elements in both images appear to have the same spacing.

3.  Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?
    Yes. It is not possible to determine if padding has been reduced since the visual difference is not noticeable.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
