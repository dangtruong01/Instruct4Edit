Step-by-step justification:
1.  The intended visual change is to make the text in the header navigation menu white. This refers to the menu items "LOCAL", "LIFESTYLE", "MORE", "HEALTH", "TIPS", "PROPERTY", and "AROUND TOWN".
2.  It's difficult to confirm the navigation menu text color change. It should be white, but the background of the nav menu is also white or very light, and it's not possible to see the contrast properly. The text appears to be the same color in both the before and after images.
3.  There is ambiguity because it is hard to confirm the change.

Final verdict:
