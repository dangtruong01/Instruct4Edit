Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to change the color and thickness of the borders on all data tables from "thick black" to "subtle, light gray." The goal is to achieve a "softer, cleaner look."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible for both tables present in the images:
    *   **Top Table (Months/Counts):** In the "before" image, the cell borders are a prominent black. In the "after" image, these borders have been replaced with a much lighter, subtle gray line, significantly reducing their visual prominence.
    *   **Bottom Table (Detailed Data):** Similarly, the "before" image shows thick, black borders defining the cells and the overall structure of this large table. In the "after" image, these have been uniformly changed to a light gray, making the table appear less rigid and more open.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction specifically targets "all data tables," and both tables visible have undergone the specified border change. The original borders were indeed "thick black," and the new borders are visibly "subtle, light gray," successfully creating a "softer, cleaner look." The implementation is consistent and complete based on the visual evidence.

**Final verdict:**
