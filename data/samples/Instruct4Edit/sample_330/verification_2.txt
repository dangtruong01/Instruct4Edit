Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests that the two dropdown menus and the single text input field, currently stacked vertically, be rearranged horizontally in a single line. This horizontal arrangement should also include clear spacing between each of these three elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** In the top-left section, below the "아파트전세월세분양권오피스빌라" text, there are two dropdown menus (indicated by the down arrows) stacked vertically, and below them, a single text input field, also stacked vertically.
    *   **After Image:** In the exact same location, the two dropdown menus and the text input field are now arranged side-by-side, forming a single horizontal line. There is discernible space between the first dropdown and the second, and between the second dropdown and the text input field.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The change is very clear. The elements that were previously vertical are now unequivocally horizontal and in a single line. The spacing between them is evident and appears consistent, fulfilling the "clear spacing" requirement. All specified elements were identified and repositioned as instructed.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
