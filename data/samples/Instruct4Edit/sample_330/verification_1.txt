Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the category labels (like '아파트', '전세') from plain text/links into more distinct, interactive-looking buttons. This involves three specific visual changes:
    *   Giving them a prominent button-like appearance with a distinct background color.
    *   Applying rounded corners to these buttons.
    *   Adding visual separation (space) between each button.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the changes are clearly visible:
    *   **Prominent button-like appearance with a distinct background color:** In the "before" image, the categories are plain text. In the "after" image, they are transformed into distinct rectangular elements with a light blue background color, making them clearly resemble buttons and stand out visually.
    *   **Rounded corners:** The corners of each blue button in the "after" image are visibly rounded, as instructed.
    *   **Visual separation between them:** There is a clear white space separating each blue button in the "after" image, providing the requested visual separation. In the "before" image, they were simply text strings adjacent to each other.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, all parts of the instruction appear to have been fully and clearly implemented without any ambiguity. The transformation from plain text to distinct, well-separated, rounded-corner buttons with a background color is complete.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
