**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to visually transform the '매매이력' text into small, clickable elements that resemble "buttons." This transformation should ideally include visual cues like a light background or a border, ensuring they stand out more from regular text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, a change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the '매매이력' text has changed color from red to blue, and an underline has been added. These visual changes do make the text appear more distinct and suggestive of a clickable element (like a hyperlink).

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant doubts regarding the full implementation of the instruction:
    *   **"Transform ... into ... buttons":** While the elements are now small and appear clickable (due to the blue color and underline), they do not visually resemble "buttons." Buttons typically imply a distinct background, a border, or a defined shape, none of which are present here. They look like standard hyperlinks, not buttons.
    *   **"possibly with a light background or a border":** This part of the instruction, which was suggested to help achieve the "button" look and make them "stand out more," was not implemented. Its absence reinforces that the elements are not visually treated as buttons.
    *   While the elements now "stand out more" and are "clickable," the core requirement to transform them into *buttons* (visually) has not been met.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
