Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to make the "Play" buttons a more visually distinct color.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** The "Play" buttons have changed color. The "Easy" buttons changed from green to a more green-yellow. The "Medium" buttons changed from orange to a more orange-yellow.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction did not specify which color to use.
**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
