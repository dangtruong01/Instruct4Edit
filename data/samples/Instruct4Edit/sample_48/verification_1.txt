Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The main heading "Jajan Makanan Singapura di Tasty Singapore" should appear larger in the "after" image.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, the heading's size appears unchanged.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The heading size in the after image does not appear larger.

Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied
