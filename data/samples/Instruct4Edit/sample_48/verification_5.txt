Step-by-step justification:
1. What is the intended visual change? The sidebar should be hidden.
2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image? Both images are identical, and the sidebar is present in both.
3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements? The instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
