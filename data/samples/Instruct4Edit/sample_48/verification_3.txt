Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the sidebar titles to a darker shade.
2. In the "after" image, the color of the sidebar titles (e.g., "Total Pageview," "Cuouth," "Arsip Cerita Cha") appears the same as in the "before" image, thus no changes can be seen.
3. There are no visible changes in the color of the sidebar titles.

Final verdict:
