Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the event images in the "You might also like" section. Based on the images, the "event images" are likely small thumbnail pictures of events.

3. The instruction is slightly unclear. It refers to "event images" but there are no apparent images in the section in the original image. However, the spacing between the text links has increased.

Final verdict:
