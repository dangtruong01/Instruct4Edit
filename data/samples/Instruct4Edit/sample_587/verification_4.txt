❌ Not Applied

Justification:
1. The instruction says "The cookie banner should be at the very bottom of the screen". We need to identify if there is a cookie banner in the original picture, and if it is repositioned to the bottom of the screen in the after picture.
2. There is no cookie banner in either image (before or after), so the instruction cannot be verified or applied.
3. Since there is no cookie banner visible in either image, the instruction has not been applied.

Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied
