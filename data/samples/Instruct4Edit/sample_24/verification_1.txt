❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to make the navigation bar background slightly transparent. This means the content behind the navigation bar should be partially visible through the navigation bar.
2. The "after" image does not show any transparency in the navigation bar. The background appears solid and opaque, just like in the "before" image.
3. There are no visible changes in the navigation bar's background transparency.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
