Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle border to the user avatars/profile images.
2. Looking at the images, there are no visible user avatars/profile images in either the "before" or "after" images.
3. Therefore, the instruction could not have been applied, as there are no elements to apply it to.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
