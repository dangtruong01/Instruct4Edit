Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction states that the navigation links at the top should have a more modern, cleaner icon style. This implies that the icons next to the links "FAQ", "Search", "Memberlist", "Usergroups", and "Register" should be visually different and presumably more modern.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible change in the icon styles next to the navigation links at the top of the page. The icons appear identical in both images.
3. There are no visible changes, so the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
