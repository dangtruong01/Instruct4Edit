Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the page content wider, utilizing more horizontal space on larger screens. This means the content area (text, images, etc.) should visibly expand in width.
2. Comparing the two images, it's difficult to definitively say if the page content has been widened. The content seems to occupy a similar amount of horizontal space in both images.
3. It's possible that the change is subtle or that other factors are limiting the width (e.g., a fixed-width container). Without a very clear visual difference, it's safest to say the instruction wasn't noticeably applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
