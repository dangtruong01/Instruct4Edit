Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a more apparent contrast between the alternating row colors in the table. This means the light and dark shades should be more visibly different from each other in the after image compared to the before image.
2. Examining both images, I can see alternating row colors in the table where posts are listed. Comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, the color difference between the rows seems to be visually the same. It is extremely hard to notice any changes.
3. I cannot visually confirm that the contrast between the row colors is more apparent.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
