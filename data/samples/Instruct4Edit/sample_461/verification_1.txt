Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the font size and add a subtle shadow to the main title. The main title is "Viewing Web pages using only an email account".
2. In the after image, the font size of the main title seems to be the same as in the before image. I don't see a shadow either.
3. The instruction is clear, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
