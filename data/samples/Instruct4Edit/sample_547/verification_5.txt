Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the footer to make it stand out. This means a visual cue should be added to the footer's top edge to give the impression of depth and separation from the main content.
2. After comparing the two images, I cannot see a visible shadow added to the footer. The footer's appearance is identical in both images.
3. There is no visible shadow in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
