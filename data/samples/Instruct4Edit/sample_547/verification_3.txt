Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a gradient background behind the main content. The gradient should transition from a dark color at the top to a lighter color at the bottom.
2. Comparing the two images, the background remains a solid white color. There is no visible gradient.
3. There is no evidence of a gradient in the second image.

Final verdict:
