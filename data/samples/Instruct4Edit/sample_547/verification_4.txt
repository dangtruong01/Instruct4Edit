Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to move the image on the right side of the main content to the left side and make it slightly transparent. However, there is no image on the right side of the main content in the original image, and therefore, nothing to move or make transparent.
2. The after image is also identical to the before image, so there are no visual changes.
3. The instruction is unclear because there is no image to move.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
