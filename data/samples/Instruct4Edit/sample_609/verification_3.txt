Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the font size of the menu items in the bottom navigation. The bottom navigation in this case appears to be the "Salesalato - Apologetica a fumetti" text at the bottom of the page.
2. Visually comparing the two images, there does not appear to be any noticeable difference in the font size of the bottom navigation menu items (Salesalato - Apologetica a fumetti) between the original and the modified images.
3. There is no visible difference in font size.

Final verdict:
