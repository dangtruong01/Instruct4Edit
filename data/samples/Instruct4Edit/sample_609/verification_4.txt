Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle shadow to be added to the article thumbnails.
2. I cannot see any visible shadows on the article thumbnails in the "after" image that were not present in the "before" image.
3. The difference between the images is negligible. There are no visible shadows added to the thumbnails.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
