Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction specifies that the social media icons in the header should be larger and have more spacing between them.
2. By visually comparing the two images, there are social media icons in the header (next to the title, consisting of gray circles). The icons appear to be unchanged between the two images, and I can't see any difference in size or spacing.
3. There is no visible change to the icons' size or spacing in the header between the two images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
