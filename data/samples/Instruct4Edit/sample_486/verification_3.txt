Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle background color to be added to the sidebar to make it stand out. The sidebar is the area on the right with "Trending" title and the list of articles.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, I do not see any visible difference in the background color of the sidebar. Both have a white background, without any added color.
3. There are no visual cues indicating a background color has been applied to the sidebar.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
