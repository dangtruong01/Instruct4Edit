Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a hover effect to the main navigation links, so their appearance changes when the mouse cursor is over them.
2. Neither of the images shows any hover effect on any links. It's not possible to confirm whether the instruction has been applied or not without interaction. Therefore, I have to assume the effect is not visually noticeable.
3. The main navigation links, such as "About", "Privacy Policy", and "Disclaimer" are present at the bottom of the page. However, there's no visible change on them in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
