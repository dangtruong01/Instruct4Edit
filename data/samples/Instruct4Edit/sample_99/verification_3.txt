Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between each person's profile (row) in the list of followers. This means increasing the vertical space between each user's profile and the next one.
2. By comparing the two images, it seems that there is no change in the vertical spacing. The spacing between profile pictures and names is identical in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the instruction was not applied in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
