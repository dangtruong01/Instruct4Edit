Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle gray background to be added to the news article section of the page. This should visually separate the article content from the surrounding elements.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, there is no noticeable change in the background of the news article section. Both images appear identical in this area.
3. There is no visible gray background added to the news article in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
