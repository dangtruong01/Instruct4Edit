Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires the main page heading, which is "Large scale genome sequencing for childhood movement disorders at ASU", to be horizontally centered on the page.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, it is evident that the heading "Large scale genome sequencing for childhood movement disorders at ASU" remains left-aligned and has not been centered.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction. The centering was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
