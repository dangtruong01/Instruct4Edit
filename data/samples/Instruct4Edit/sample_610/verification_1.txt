❌ Not Applied

Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to align the logo and header images on one line with no gaps.
2. The images in the "after" image appear visually identical to the "before" image. There is no visible change to the alignment of the logo and header images. They still appear on separate lines.
3. There are no visible changes that align the logo and header images.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
