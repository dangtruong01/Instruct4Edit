Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to highlight the "News" link in the top navigation bar. This means visually differentiating the "News" link from the other links in the navigation bar.
2. Comparing the after image to the before image, I cannot see any change in the appearance of the "News" link. It looks identical to the other links.
3. There is no highlighting, different color, or any other visual cue that indicates the "News" link is currently selected.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
