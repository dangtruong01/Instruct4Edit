Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the styling of the left navigation by adding a light gray background and a subtle border.
2. Looking at the images, the background of the navigation does not seem to have changed, nor does a border appear to be visible.
3. I do not see the changes mentioned in the instruction.

Final verdict:
