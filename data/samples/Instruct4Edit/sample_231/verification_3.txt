Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing between the main article content and the comment section to improve their visual separation. Specifically, this means adding more empty space between the last element of the article content (which appears to be "L'immagine in copertina in un'illustrazione di Bob Staake (leggermente "ansalvarizzata").") and the heading of the comment section ("Lascia un commento").

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the vertical gap between the line "L'immagine in copertina in un'illustrazione di Bob Staake (leggermente "ansalvarizzata")." and the "Lascia un commento" heading is noticeably larger than in the "before" image. The added space creates a more distinct visual break between the article and the comments.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was straightforward, and the visual implementation in the "after" image directly addresses it by adding a clear increase in vertical space between the specified sections.

Final verdict:
