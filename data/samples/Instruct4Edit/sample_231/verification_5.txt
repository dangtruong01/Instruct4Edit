Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks to increase the horizontal empty space (left and right margins/padding) around the "main content block." This means the content area should appear visually narrower, with more whitespace between it and the page edges, thereby giving the content "more breathing room."

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, the main text content block (and the subsequent form elements) is noticeably narrower than in the "before" image. Consequently, the white space on both the left and right sides of this content block has increased significantly. The content appears more centered and less stretched across the full width of the page, achieving the desired "breathing room."

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was straightforward, and its visual implementation is clear and consistent across the main content area of the page. The entire content area (text and form fields) has been affected appropriately, not just a portion.

**Final verdict:**
