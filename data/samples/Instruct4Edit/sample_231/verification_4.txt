Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to add a subtle border to all text input fields within the comment form. The goal is to make these fields more distinct and clearly identifiable as interactive elements that users can type into.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, the small text input fields (e.g., those labeled "Compila questo campo", "Inserisci un indirizzo email valido", "Nome", "Email", "Sito web") appear as simple lines of text, making it difficult to immediately perceive them as interactive input areas. They essentially lack a visible bounding box.
    *   In the "after" image, these same small text input fields now have a thin, light grey border around them, clearly defining their interactive area. This border is subtle, as requested.
    *   The larger text area (for the comment body) already had a visible border in the "before" image, and it appears to remain unchanged in the "after" image. This is not a failure to implement, as the instruction was to *add* a border where it would make them *more clearly* interactive, implying they previously lacked this clarity. The small fields were the primary beneficiaries of this change.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The applied borders are subtle, they are on the text input fields, and they successfully make the fields look more clearly like interactive elements. The instruction was fully met.

Final verdict:
