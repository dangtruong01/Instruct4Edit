Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing between lines of text (line-height or leading) specifically within the main article content. This should result in a less dense and more open appearance of the text blocks.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the main article content (the long paragraphs of text) between the "before" and "after" images, the "after" image distinctly shows more vertical space between each line of text within the paragraphs. The text blocks in the "after" image appear less cramped and have improved readability due to this increased line spacing. This change is consistently applied throughout the main article content.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was specifically for "lines of text in the main article," and the change has been applied precisely to that area. Other text elements like headings, footers, or the comments section do not appear to have been affected, which is appropriate given the scope of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
