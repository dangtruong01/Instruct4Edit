Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction is to make the "Invia commento" button more prominent by changing its background to a distinct color, thereby increasing its noticeability.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
- In the "before" image, the "Invia commento" button has a light gray background, making it blend significantly with the white page background.
- In the "after" image, the "Invia commento" button's background has been changed to a prominent red color. This color is distinctly different from the surrounding elements and the previous button state. The text color also changed from black to white to maintain readability against the new background.

The change is very clearly visible and makes the button significantly more noticeable.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The instruction was specifically about changing the background color to make it more noticeable, and this has been achieved fully and unambiguously. The new red color is indeed distinct.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
