Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the main content area. The main content area is the white section containing the article text and other elements.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any visible border around the white content area in the "after" image that was not present in the "before" image.
3. There are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements, however, the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
