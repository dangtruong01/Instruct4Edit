Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between lines of text in the main article, i.e., the body of the article.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, the line spacing in the main article appears to be negligibly increased. The change is so small that it's difficult to confirm with certainty.
3. Due to the very subtle change, I cannot confidently say the instruction was fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
