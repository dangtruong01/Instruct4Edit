Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the header. In this case, the header is the gray section at the very top of the page containing the "RADIO EXPRES" logo.
2. By comparing the before and after images, there's no visible difference in the header. I can't see a shadow added to the header in the after image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself. It's clear about the desired change, but it isn't visible in the images provided.

Final verdict:
