Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add padding around the edges of the main content area. This means adding space on the left and right sides of the content, preventing it from touching the screen's edges.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible change in the padding around the main content area. The content still touches the sides of the screen in the "after" image, just as it did in the "before" image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible in the provided images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
