Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the "Zdieľaj" button a brighter, more prominent color. This implies a change to the button's color to make it stand out more.

3. There are no ambiguities or missing elements. The color change is clearly visible.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
