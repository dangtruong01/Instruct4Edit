Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Increase the vertical space between the text "See all snapshots" and the table that follows.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. There is no noticeable change in the vertical spacing.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes. The spacing does not appear to have been increased.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
