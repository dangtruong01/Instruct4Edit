Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to make the background of the navigation items ("About", "Snapshots", etc.) slightly transparent. This would mean the background color of those items should allow some of the content behind them to be visible.
2. I see no difference between the "before" and "after" image. The background of the navigation items remains opaque blue.
3. The change is not visible.

Final verdict:
