Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction aims to increase the font size of the main heading, which is "zip-stream."
2.  **Is the change visible?:** The font size of "zip-stream" appears to be the same in both images.
3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The font size of the heading is not increased.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
