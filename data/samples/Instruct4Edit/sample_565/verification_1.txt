Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the article title and the publication date. However, the article title is not present in the images. I can only see the date (29/01/2019).
2. Since there's no article title to compare the spacing with, I cannot confirm if the spacing has been increased.
3. The instruction relies on the presence of an article title, which is absent, making the instruction impossible to verify.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
