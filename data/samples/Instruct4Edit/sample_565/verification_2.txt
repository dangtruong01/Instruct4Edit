Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the color of the navigation links (HOME, O HOSPITAL, NOTICIAS, PROCESSO SELETIVO, FALE CONOSCO, TRANSPARÊNCIA) to a darker shade of gray.
2. Comparing the two images, the navigation links appear to be the same color in both the "before" and "after" images. There's no discernible change in the shade of gray.
3. There are no ambiguities, but the instruction was not visibly implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
