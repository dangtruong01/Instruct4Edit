Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the main article image.
2. Comparing the two images, I can see the main article image in both. However, I cannot see any change to the image in the second "after" image. There is no border around the main article image.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the design change does not seem to have been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
