Here's my review based on your instructions:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   To make the input fields within the "Stay Connected" form more visually defined with a clear border.
    *   To make the submit button a bolder color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Input Fields:** Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the input fields (the four horizontal lines below "FREE PRACTISE GUIDE") are extremely subtle, almost indistinguishable from the background, appearing as faint underlines. In the "after" image, these fields now have distinct, light gray rectangular borders, making them clearly visible and defined as input areas.
    *   **Submit Button:** Yes, this change is also clearly visible. In the "before" image, the submit button (to the right of the input fields, currently displaying "Submit") is a very pale, almost white color, making it blend into the background. In the "after" image, this button has been changed to a prominent, dark blue color, which is significantly bolder than its original appearance.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. Both parts of the instruction have been implemented clearly and completely based on visual comparison. The input fields gained clear borders, and the submit button gained a bolder color.

**Final verdict:**
