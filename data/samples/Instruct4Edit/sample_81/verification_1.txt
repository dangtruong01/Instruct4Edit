As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I will compare the two images based solely on visible changes.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a "subtle background highlight" to the "main navigation items in the header" specifically "when you hover over them". This implies an interactive visual effect that appears upon user interaction (hover).

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots and are visually identical. A "hover" effect is dynamic and depends on user interaction. For such an effect to be visible in a static image, the screenshot would need to have been captured *while* a navigation item was being hovered over, and it would need to show a visible difference compared to the non-hovered state. No such difference or active hover state is visible in the "after" image, nor are there any other general styling changes to the navigation items that might indicate the implementation of this feature in its default state.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, the primary ambiguity is that a hover effect cannot be confirmed or denied from static images alone, unless the "after" image explicitly shows an element *in a hovered state*. Since both images are identical and static, it's impossible to visually verify the implementation of a dynamic hover effect. However, as a visual reviewer, if no visual change is evident, the instruction cannot be considered "fully applied" visually.
