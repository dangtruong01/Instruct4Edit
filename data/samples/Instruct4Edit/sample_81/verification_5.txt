Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction was to add more horizontal space between the individual links located in the website footer.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No, this change is not visible. Upon close inspection of the footer section at the bottom of both images, the links "Privacy Policy", "Cookie Policy", "Apps", "Swing Review", and "SoM" have the exact same spacing between them in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no discernible increase in the gap separating these links.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts. The visual comparison clearly shows that the spacing between the footer links remains unchanged.

Final verdict:
