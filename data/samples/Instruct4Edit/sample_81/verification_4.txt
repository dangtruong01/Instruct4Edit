Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for the text tags "psychology" and "technique" (found below the article title) to be transformed. Instead of appearing as plain text, they should become small, visually distinct UI elements that resemble "badges" and feature a soft background color.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, "Psychologytechnique,Jun 30, 2021" appears as a single, unformatted line of text. The words "psychology" and "technique" are not visually separated or styled as distinct elements.
    *   In the "after" image, "PSYCHOLOGY" and "TECHNIQUE" are now enclosed within separate, rounded-corner rectangles. Each rectangle has a light, subtle background color (a soft grey/beige tone) that makes it stand out. They are clearly distinct from each other and appear to be of a suitable "small" size relative to the surrounding content. The date "Jun 30, 2021" is no longer present on this line, but the instruction specifically focused on styling the tags, not preserving the date's position.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements regarding the instruction's specific requirements.
    *   **"small"**: The badges are appropriately sized, not overly large or intrusive.
    *   **"distinct badges"**: They are clearly separated, have a badge-like shape (rounded rectangles), and are visually distinct from surrounding text. The capitalization (PSYCHOLOGY, TECHNIQUE) further enhances their distinctness, although not explicitly requested, it aligns with the "distinct" goal.
    *   **"soft background"**: The background color used is light and subtle, fitting the description of "soft."
    The instruction was solely about styling the tags themselves, and this has been fully achieved.

Final verdict:
