Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle border to the table to better define the columns on the page. However, there is no table visible in the original image.
2. As there is no table, the instruction could not be applied.
3. It is possible the instruction refers to the layout in general, trying to make the columns on the page more visually separate. However, this is unclear and no border was applied to the layout.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
