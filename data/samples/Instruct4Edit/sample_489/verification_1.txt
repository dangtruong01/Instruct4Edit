Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the size of the navigation links on the left side and add a subtle background color on hover.
2. The size of the navigation links appears to have increased slightly in the after image. There is no indication of a hover state to see the background color.
3. It's difficult to verify the background color on hover without interactivity, so I can only confirm a possible size change.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
