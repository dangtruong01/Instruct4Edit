Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the date above the headline visually less prominent by using a lighter color and a smaller font size, thus separating it from the headline.
2. Comparing the "after" image to the "before" image, the date "07Apr16" remains visually identical in both images. There is no change in color or font size.
3. The instruction appears to be completely unfulfilled as there is no change to the date's appearance.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
