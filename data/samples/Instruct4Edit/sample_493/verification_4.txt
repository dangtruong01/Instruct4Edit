Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to increase the spacing between the footer widgets' text for better readability. Looking at the images, the footer widgets are in the black area at the bottom of the images.
2. Visually comparing the before and after images, the spacing between the list items in the footer appears to be slightly increased. However, it is a very minor change and not easily noticeable.
3. The change is so subtle that it is difficult to definitively say that the instruction was fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
