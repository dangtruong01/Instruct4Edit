Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires a background color change on hover for sub-menu items in the main navigation.
2. The images do not show any interactive state (hover) of the menu items. It's impossible to confirm any background color change without observing the hover state.
3. Since no hover state is visible, there is no way to verify if the instruction was implemented.

Final verdict:
