Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow effect to the header. The header is the area containing "Plantilla de excel" and the menu icon.
2. Visually comparing the before and after images, there is no discernible shadow effect added to the header.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the change is not visible in the second image.

Final verdict:
