Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to center the "category selection dropdown" within the footer widget area.
2. Comparing the two images, it appears that the dropdown has been slightly moved, but it's difficult to tell with certainty if it's perfectly centered. The surrounding content, particularly the "CATEGORIAS" label, might influence the perception of centering.
3. Due to the slight movement and difficulty in precisely assessing centering, there is ambiguity.

Final verdict:
