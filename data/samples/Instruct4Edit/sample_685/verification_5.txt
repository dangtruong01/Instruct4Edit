**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to apply two specific visual changes to *every* Pokémon name in the main list:
    *   A slight background fill (i.e., a background color).
    *   A small amount of padding around each name within its background.
    The purpose was to create more visual separation between individual names, making them stand out as distinct elements.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, for a significant portion of the Pokémon names, the change is clearly visible. In the "after" image, many names now have a distinct light grey background fill and noticeable padding around the text, which was entirely absent in the "before" image. This successfully creates visual separation for those names where the change was applied.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant missing element regarding the scope of the application. The instruction stated "Give *each* Pokémon name in the main list," implying that the change should be applied universally to all names displayed. However, in the "after" image, a substantial number of Pokémon names, particularly those in the lower, larger block of text (e.g., "nosperapti nidoran male", "nosperapti norfang", "noctunoire noidekoko", "noeneuof nidorhino", etc.), still appear as plain black text on a white background, completely lacking the instructed background fill and padding. Therefore, the implementation is incomplete.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
