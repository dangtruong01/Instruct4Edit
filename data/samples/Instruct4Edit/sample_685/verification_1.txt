Here's my step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to create a continuous flow for the list of Pokémon names by moving all advertisement labels ("Publicité") from within or directly adjacent to the main text content to separate, distinct side areas.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image Analysis:**
        *   There are three instances of "Publicité".
        *   The first "Publicité" is located on the left, below the first line of Pokémon names ("Nidoran Noctali"). While not directly *in* the flow, it's very close and on the same horizontal plane as the text block start.
        *   The second "Publicité" is positioned *within* the main block of Pokémon names, on the right side, causing the text to wrap around it and clearly interrupting the flow.
        *   The third "Publicité" is at the bottom left, below the explanatory text about the list.
    *   **After Image Analysis:**
        *   All three "Publicité" instances have been relocated.
        *   One "Publicité" is now positioned at the far top-left, clearly outside the main content column.
        *   Another "Publicité" is at the far top-right, mirroring the top-left one, also clearly outside the main content column.
        *   The third "Publicité" is now on the right side, vertically aligned with the middle section of the Pokémon list, but crucially, it is positioned *outside* the text column, allowing the Pokémon names to flow in a single, uninterrupted block.
        *   The list of Pokémon names now flows continuously from top to bottom without any breaks or wrapping caused by the "Publicité" elements.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. All "Publicité" elements were moved to side locations, and the central list of Pokémon names is now perfectly continuous, fulfilling both parts of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
