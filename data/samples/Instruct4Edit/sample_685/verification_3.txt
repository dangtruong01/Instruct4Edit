Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the font size and boldness of the main title "Pokémon en N" to enhance its visual weight and impact.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size:** Yes, the text "Pokémon en N" in the "after" image is visibly larger than in the "before" image. It occupies more space and appears more prominent.
    *   **Boldness:** Yes, the text "Pokémon en N" in the "after" image is distinctly bolder and darker, indicating a significant increase in font weight compared to the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both aspects of the instruction (increased font size and increased boldness) are clearly and unambiguously applied to the specified title. The change effectively gives the title more visual weight and impact, fulfilling the stated goal.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
