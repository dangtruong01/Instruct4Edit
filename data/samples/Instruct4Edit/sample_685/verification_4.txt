**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests an enhancement to the visual feedback for the *selected letter* within the alphabetical navigation (the "A B C... Z" sequence at the bottom). This enhancement was suggested to be a distinct background fill or a more pronounced outline, to make the selected letter visually stand out.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. In both the "before" and "after" images, the alphabetical navigation remains identical. There is no visible change to any letter in the sequence. Specifically, the letter 'N' (which is implied to be the selected letter given the page content "Pokémon en N") does not have a distinct background fill, a more pronounced outline, or any other visual differentiator in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. All letters in the alphabetical navigation appear to be plain black text in both images.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The instruction was not implemented visually. The selected letter ('N' or any other letter if a different one were to be selected) shows no enhanced visual feedback whatsoever.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
