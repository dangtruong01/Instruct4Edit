Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a border around the sidebar widgets. This means that visual borders should be added around the "Post navigation," "Archives," and "Meta" sections.
2. Comparing the "after" image to the "before" image, it appears that borders have been added around the "Archives" section. However, there are no borders around the "Post navigation" or "Meta" sections.
3. The instruction was only partially implemented.

Final verdict:
