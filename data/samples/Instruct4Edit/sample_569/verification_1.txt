Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the navigation bar to visually lift it from the page. This will make the navigation bar appear elevated.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to detect a difference. Both images appear to have the same navigation bar without a visible shadow.
3. I do not see a shadow in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
