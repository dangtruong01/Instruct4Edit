Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the font color of the archive links (located in the sidebar) to a darker shade of gray.
2. Comparing the two images, I can see the archive links. Upon close examination, there is no visible change in the color of the font in the archive links.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
