Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to increase the spacing between sections of information in the main content area. This means more whitespace between blocks of text or distinct information groups.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the spacing appears increased between sections such as the "Описание из номенклатуры" section and the next one, "Комментарий из прайс-листа". Similarly, the spacing is also visibly increased between the parameters block and the previous text block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, the change is visible and aligns with the instruction.

**Final verdict: ✅ Fully Applied**
