Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The instruction is to change the top navigation bar to a solid, slightly darker shade of gray.

2.  **Visibility of change:** The "after" image shows a top navigation bar with a changed color, compared to the "before" image. The "after" image's top navigation bar is a darker shade of gray.

3.  **Doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements:** The change seems fully implemented.

**Final verdict:** âœ… Fully Applied
