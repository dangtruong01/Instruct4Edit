**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aimed to update the visual appearance of both the search input field and its "GO" button. This included making them look "softer" and "more modern," specifically suggesting "slightly rounded corners" for both, and ensuring "clearer separation from the surrounding elements."

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
- **"GO" Button:** Yes, the "GO" button has been significantly altered. It now features a dark grey background with white text, giving it a much softer and more modern aesthetic compared to its previous stark black border. Crucially, it clearly exhibits slightly rounded corners and its new distinct color provides clear separation from the white background.
- **Search Input Field:** The changes to the search input field are visible but less aligned with the full instruction. The harsh black border has been removed, which makes it visually "softer." It now has a very subtle light grey background. However, it *does not* have rounded corners; it remains rectangular.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there are clear missing elements and ambiguities regarding the search input field:
- **Missing Rounded Corners:** The instruction stated "perhaps with slightly rounded corners" for *both* the input field *and* the "GO" button. While the "GO" button received them, the search input field did not.
- **Ambiguous Separation:** The instruction asked for "clearer separation from the surrounding elements." For the search input field, the removal of its clear border and the introduction of a very subtle background make it blend much *more* with the surrounding white background, rather than providing "clearer separation" as a distinct interactive element. It appears to be less defined than before, which contradicts the "clearer separation" aspect of the instruction.
