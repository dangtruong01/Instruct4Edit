Here's a detailed comparison and justification:

**Instruction:** Ensure the large image at the top of the page scales to fit the width and appears more prominently, potentially adding an overlay or title text on top if needed.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to:
    *   Make the large image at the top (currently a placeholder) occupy the full width of the page.
    *   Increase its visual prominence, likely as a result of the increased size.
    *   *Optionally*, add text (an overlay or title) directly *on top* of this image.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Scaling to fit the width:** No. The large image placeholder at the top of the page in the "after" image maintains the exact same width and position as it had in the "before" image. It does not scale to fit the page's width.
    *   **Appears more prominently:** No. Since the image placeholder's size and position remain unchanged, its visual prominence due to scaling is not increased.
    *   **Potentially adding an overlay or title text on top:** Text ("Albia Industrial Development" and "Monroe County's Economic Growth Engine") has been added. However, this text is positioned *to the left of* the image placeholder, not *on top of* it as an overlay or title text as suggested by the instruction. This is a significant deviation from the specified placement.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are significant missing elements and misinterpretations:
    *   The core instruction to "scale to fit the width" was not implemented at all. The image's dimensions and position are identical.
    *   Consequently, the image does not "appear more prominently" due to scaling.
    *   While text was added, its placement is incorrect; it's adjacent to the image, not an overlay or title *on top* of it.
