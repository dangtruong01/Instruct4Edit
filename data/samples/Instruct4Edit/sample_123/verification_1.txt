**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intended to make the text of the links located in the left sidebar menu legible and distinct against their background. This implies that they were either missing, completely blended into the background, or had very low contrast in the "before" state.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the large white area on the left, below the main navigation bar, is empty of any visible text links. It appears as a blank space. In contrast, the "after" image shows a comprehensive list of text links (e.g., "Home Base Iowa", "Albia Industrial (AIDC)", "Buildings & Sites", etc.) now present within that left sidebar area. These links are rendered in black text against the white background, providing excellent contrast and visibility.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction specifically asked to make the text color of the links visible against their background. In the "before" image, they were entirely absent or invisible. In the "after" image, they are fully present and highly visible due to the clear contrast between the black text and the white background. The instruction has been fully implemented without ambiguity.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
