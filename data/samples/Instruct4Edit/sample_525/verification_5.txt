Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to make the website name in the header larger and bolder.
2. Comparing the two images, the website name "YİĞİT TUĞRUL TÜRKANİ" in the header appears to be the same size and weight in both images. There is no visible change in size or boldness.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
