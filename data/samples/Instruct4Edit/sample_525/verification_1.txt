Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the text contrast in the post filter message. This means making the text more distinct from the background, generally by making it darker if the background is light, or lighter if the background is dark.
2. The text in the post filter message in the first image is a light grey color. The text in the post filter message in the second image appears to be the same light grey color.
3. I cannot see any change in the text contrast between the two images.

Final verdict:
