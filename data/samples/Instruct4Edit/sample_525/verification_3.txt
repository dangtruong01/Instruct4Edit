Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color of the main navigation tabs to match the header. The main navigation tabs are "ANA SAYFA", "EKONOMİ TAKVİMİ", and "UYARI" at the top of the page.
2. In the original image, these tabs do not have a background color. In the modified image, they have a light gray background, which appears to match the header's background color.
3. The change seems fully implemented, and there are no ambiguities.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
