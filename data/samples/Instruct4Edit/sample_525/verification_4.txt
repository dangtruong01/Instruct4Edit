Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the post containers.
2. I need to compare the post container area in both images to see if a shadow effect has been applied.
3. After comparing, I do not observe any shadow effect on the post container in the second image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
