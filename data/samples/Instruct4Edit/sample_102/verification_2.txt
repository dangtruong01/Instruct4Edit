Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the sidebar widgets. This means visually highlighting each widget area.
2. In the "after" image, there is a very subtle gray border around the "Recent Posts" widget in the sidebar, which was not present in the "before" image. This indicates the instruction has been applied, though very subtly.
3. While subtle, the change is visible.

Final verdict:
