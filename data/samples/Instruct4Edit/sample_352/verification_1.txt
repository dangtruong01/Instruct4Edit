Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to reduce the transparency of the white background in the page header. This means the white background should appear more solid and less see-through.
2. By comparing the two images, it is difficult to see a clear difference in the transparency of the header background. The white background in the header seems to have the same degree of transparency in both images.
3. There's a doubt as to whether the change was actually applied or if it's subtle to the point of being unnoticeable.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
