Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the scroll-to-top arrow to a circular shape. Since there is no visible scroll-to-top arrow in the before image, I assume it would be located at the bottom right of the page.
2. I cannot find any scroll-to-top arrow at all, let alone a circular one, in the after image.
3. There's a complete absence of the element in question in the after image.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
