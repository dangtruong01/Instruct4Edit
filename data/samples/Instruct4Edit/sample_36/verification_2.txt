Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is an increase in the vertical spacing between the list items within the main content area. This should make each list item easier to read and visually separate it from the others.
2. The spacing between list items appears to be negligibly changed if at all.
3. There is a slight change in the spacing, but its barely noticeable.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
