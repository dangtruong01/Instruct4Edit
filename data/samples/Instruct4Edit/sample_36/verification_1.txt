Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction is to change the navigation bar's color to a darker and solid color.

2.  **Visibility of Change:** The "after" image does NOT show a clear difference in color for the navigation bar compared to the "before" image. The navigation bar is white in both images.

3.  **Doubts, Ambiguities, or Missing Elements:** The instruction was not followed. The navigation bar is still white.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
