Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to add a subtle shadow to the thread cards (the area containing the text and Twitter information) to make them stand out.
2. There's no visible shadow added to the cards in the "after" image when compared to the "before" image. The design of the thread cards, specifically their background and borders, seems identical in both images.
3. The instruction's implementation is absent.

Final verdict:
