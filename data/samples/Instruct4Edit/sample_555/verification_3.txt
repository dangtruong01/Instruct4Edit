Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle border around the sidebar. The sidebar appears to be on the left-hand side of the images.
2. Looking at the two images, I cannot see any visible border added to the sidebar in the second (after) image, when compared to the first (before) image.
3. There are no visible changes that indicate a border has been added around the sidebar.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
