Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the site title and the site description in the header.
2. Visually comparing the two images, it is hard to be certain if the spacing between the site title ("El Mundo Viajes") and site description ("Destinos de viaje curiosos y maravillosos") has increased in the after image.
3. Because the change is ambiguous, there's doubt whether the instruction was fully applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
