Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to change the background color to a softer, more neutral shade. This means the "after" image should have a background color that is less harsh and more subdued compared to the original.
2. Upon comparing the two images, the background color appears to be virtually identical. There is no discernible change to a softer or more neutral shade.
3. There is no visible change in the background color.

Final verdict:
