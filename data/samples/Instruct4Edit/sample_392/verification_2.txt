Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the author information (on the left side of each post) and the message content (on the right side of each post). This should make each post more readable by visually separating the metadata from the actual message.
2. Comparing the two images, the space between the author information (e.g., "klotz, Joined: 13 Mar 2001...") and the message content (e.g., "This forum is for special postings of sale items...") appears to be identical. There is no visible change in spacing.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction itself, but the modified image doesn't show any evidence of the change being implemented.

Final verdict:
