Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the font of the main title "Graflex.org" to a more prominent and modern one. This means the font should ideally be bolder, visually different, and perhaps larger than the original.
2. Comparing the two images, the font of "Graflex.org" appears to be visually identical. There's no apparent change in its typeface, weight, or size.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible in the after image.

Final verdict:
