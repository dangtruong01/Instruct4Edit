Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to apply rounded corners to the tables in the image.
2. Looking at both images, there are no apparent changes to the corners of any of the tables.
3. It is possible that the tables are not visually distinctive enough, but there are table-like structures around the message board, the select box, and other elements. None of these show evidence of rounded corners.

Final verdict:
