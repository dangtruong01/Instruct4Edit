Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle background color to the sidebar. It is not explicitly stated where the sidebar is, but considering the image provided, it is likely to be the left side where the "Cart" section is located.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visible background color added to the area surrounding the "Cart" section.
3. There are no ambiguous elements, the change is simply missing.

Final verdict:
