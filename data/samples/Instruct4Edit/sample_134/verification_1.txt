Here's my cautious review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the header for larger screens. It requires the removal of a 'MENU' button/text and, in its place, the direct display of main navigation menu items within the header, specifically to the right of the logo.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** In the top-left corner, the text "MENU" is prominently displayed, likely serving as a button or toggle for navigation. No direct navigation links are visible in the header.
*   **After Image:**
    *   The "MENU" text/button previously in the top-left is completely gone.
    *   In the top-right portion of the header, a set of navigation links ("Home", "Contact us", "Privacy Policy", "Disclaimer", "Request Game Answers") has appeared.
    *   These links are clearly positioned to the right of the logo placeholder (the green/yellow box in the top-left).

Based on this visual comparison, the change is clearly visible and aligns with the instruction.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
*   The instruction specifies "main navigation menu items." The introduced items ("Home", "Contact us", "Privacy Policy", "Disclaimer", "Request Game Answers") appear to be standard main navigation elements.
*   The removal of the 'MENU' button is unambiguous.
*   The positioning "to the right of the logo" is clearly achieved, with the logo being represented by the placeholder area.
*   The instruction implies this is for "larger screens," and the desktop-like aspect ratio of the images supports this context.

No doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements are apparent from a purely visual standpoint.

**Final verdict:**
