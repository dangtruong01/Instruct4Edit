Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction requires the main heading "Airsoft Guns" to be made larger and bolder.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. The heading "Airsoft Game Types: Paratroopers" appears to be the same in both images. The text style and size are the same. The instruction doesn't specify which heading to change, and there's no change to the heading that is at the top of the content.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The instruction doesn't specify *which* heading named "Airsoft Guns" to change. The only place "Airsoft Guns" appears is in the "Airsoft Game Types: Paratroopers" heading, which is not changed.

**Final verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
