Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The background color of the entire page should change from the original white color to a light gray color.
2.  **Visibility:** Upon comparing the images, there appears to be no visible change in the background color. The modified image still has a white background.
3.  **Doubts and Ambiguities:** The instruction was clear, but the intended visual change is not present in the modified image.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
