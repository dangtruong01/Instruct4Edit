Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to change the color of the light green bar at the top to a more vibrant, modern shade of green.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see any visual difference in the green bar at the top. It appears to be the same color in both images.
3. There are no visible changes.

Final verdict:
