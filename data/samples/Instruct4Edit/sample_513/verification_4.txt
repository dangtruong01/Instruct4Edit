Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle border and a slightly different background color to the mini-calendar.
2. Comparing the two images, it is difficult to see any changes related to the mini-calendar's background or borders. The mini-calendar seems to remain the same in both images.
3. There is no visible change in the mini-calendar's appearance. The borders and background color are the same.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
