Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reduce the vertical height and "stretched" appearance of specific partner logos that are disproportionately tall and narrow. The goal is for these logos to become more proportionate to the other partner logos and occupy less vertical space.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the visual problem of excessive vertical stretching is largely resolved in the "after" image for the elements that were previously problematic.
    *   The "NEUROCHIRURGIE" logo (specifically the blue brain-like graphic above the text) was a tall and narrow element. In the "after" image, this logo has been visibly scaled down, making it less tall and narrow and more proportionate. This directly aligns with "adjust" and "don't stretch vertically as much."
    *   The "WIR SIND Kultiviert" image block, the "Orthomol" product images (below the text logo), and the entire "Fitmart" logo/product display were all significantly tall and narrow. In the "after" image, these specific elements are entirely absent. By removing them, the issue of their vertical stretching is resolved.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant ambiguity. The instruction explicitly states "Adjust the tall, narrow partner logos."
    *   For the "NEUROCHIRURGIE" logo, the action taken was a clear "adjustment" (resizing) of the existing logo. This part of the instruction is fulfilled.
    *   However, for the "WIR SIND Kultiviert" image, the "Orthomol" product images, and the "Fitmart" logo/product display, the action taken was *removal* rather than *adjustment*. While removing them certainly eliminates their "tall, narrow" and "stretched vertically" appearance, "removing" is not synonymous with "adjusting." "Adjusting" typically implies modifying an existing element (e.g., resizing, repositioning, restyling), not deleting it entirely. If the intent was for elements to be removed, the instruction should have been phrased to include removal as an option (e.g., "Adjust or remove..."). As a highly cautious reviewer, the distinction between "adjusting an element" and "removing an element" is critical for precise instruction adherence. The instruction was to *adjust* the logos, not to *selectively remove* logos that fit the description.

**Final verdict:**
