Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a company logo or icon to the top left of the header area. The header area is defined as the top navigation bar containing elements like "06155-828276", "Über Uns", "Das Team", etc. The specific placement is the extreme top-left of this bar.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon comparing the "before" image (first) and the "after" image (second), the header area, specifically the top-left corner, remains identical in both. There is no logo or icon present in the top-left of the header in the "after" image that was not there in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the requested element (company logo/icon) is entirely missing from the specified location in the "after" image. The instruction was not implemented visually.

**Final verdict:**
- ❌ Not Applied
