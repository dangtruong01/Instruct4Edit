Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intends to:
*   Increase the spacing around the footer content, especially the copyright and "Impressum" link (more "breathing room").
*   Improve the legibility of these elements (make them "easy to read").
*   Adjust their positioning (ensure they are "appropriately aligned").

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the changes are clearly visible:
*   **Breathing Room:** In the "after" image, "Impressum" is now placed on a line above the copyright information, creating clear vertical separation and more breathing room between these two elements. The overall footer content also appears to have more vertical padding above and below it, subtly increasing its surrounding space.
*   **Easy to Read:** The "Impressum" text has changed from a very faint grey to a more prominent light blue/cyan color, significantly improving its contrast against the dark background and making it much easier to read. The copyright text also benefits from being on its own line.
*   **Appropriately Aligned:** In the "after" image, both the "Impressum" and the copyright text are now center-aligned, whereas they were left-aligned in the "before" image. Center alignment is a common and often appropriate choice for footers, especially with limited content.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, all aspects of the instruction have been clearly addressed. The color change for "Impressum" significantly enhances readability, the line break adds breathing room, and the change to center alignment covers the "appropriately aligned" aspect. The implementation is clear and effective.

**Final verdict:**
