Here's the visual UI/UX review:

**Instruction:** Refine the main heading for the partner section to remove the dark shadow and any background color, making it look cleaner and more integrated with the page.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main heading "Mit diesen Partnern arbeiten wir sehr gerne zusammen !" appear cleaner by removing its dark text shadow and ensuring it has no background color, thus integrating it better with the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the main heading "Mit diesen Partnern arbeiten wir sehr gerne zusammen !" clearly exhibits a subtle dark text shadow, particularly visible around the edges of the letters. In the "after" image, this dark text shadow has been completely removed. The text now appears sharper and flat against the background. Regarding the "background color" part of the instruction, the heading did not have an explicit background color in the "before" image, and it continues to not have one in the "after" image, maintaining its transparent background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The removal of the dark text shadow is clear and unambiguous. The instruction regarding the background color was also fully met as there was no background color to remove, and none was added. The heading visually appears cleaner and more integrated as a result.

**Final verdict:**
