Here's my analysis:

1.  **Intended visual change:** The background of the main navigation bar (the top bar with "Community," "Answers," and "App") should be a lighter shade of gray.
2.  **Visibility:** The background of the navigation bar appears virtually identical in both images. There's no apparent change in the gray color.
3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The color appears the same, thus there's no color change.

**Final verdict:** ‚ùå Not Applied
