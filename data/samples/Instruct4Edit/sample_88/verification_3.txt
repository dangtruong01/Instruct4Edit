**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to change the horizontal alignment of the image featuring kites/birds and the text directly beneath it (`დიაღლის ფსიქოლოგია (ნაწილი Ⅰ)`) from their initial left-aligned position to a horizontally centered position within the main content area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   In the "before" image, both the kite/bird image and the text immediately below it are aligned to the left side of the content area.
    *   In the "after" image, both the image and the text have been moved horizontally to the center of the content area. The image appears to be horizontally centered, and the text below it is also centered, aligning directly under the now-centered image. The centering respects the visible boundaries of the main content block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The specific elements to be centered are clear, and the "main content area" can be reasonably interpreted as the visible content width where these elements are placed (bounded by the existing elements above and below them). The centering is distinct and correctly applied to both specified elements.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
