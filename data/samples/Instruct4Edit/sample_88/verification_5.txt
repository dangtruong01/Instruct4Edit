**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   The instruction requests two specific visual changes:
        *   An increase in the font size of "general paragraph text".
        *   An increase in the vertical spacing (line-height) between lines of this text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size:** No. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the font size of the text element "დიაივიის ფსიქოლოგია (ნაწილი I)" located below the image (the most probable candidate for "general paragraph text" in this layout) shows no discernible difference. The text in the left navigation menu also appears to have the exact same font size in both images.
    *   **Line Spacing:** No. The text identified as "general paragraph text" (below the image) is a single line, thus making it impossible to observe any change in line spacing. For the menu items, which are presented as lists, the vertical spacing between them is visually identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There are no multi-line text blocks where line-height could be evaluated.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   There is no visual evidence in the "after" image to suggest that either the font size of "general paragraph text" was increased or that additional space was added between lines. Both aspects of the instruction appear to be entirely unaddressed visually.

**Final verdict:**
-   ❌ Not Applied
