Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to change the background color of the very bottom section of the page (the green bar containing the logo) to a darker shade.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not visible. The background color of the green bar at the very bottom of the page is identical in both the "before" and "after" images. It has not been changed to a darker color.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the instruction was clearly not applied to the specified element. The green background color of the bottom section remains unchanged.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
