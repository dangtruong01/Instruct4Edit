Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction intends to increase the vertical spacing (either through margin or padding) immediately above and below the main page title, which is identified as the dark grey bar containing the text "დიდიოსი ფსიქოლოგია (ნაწილი 1)". This means there should be more empty vertical space between the element just above the title (the 'X' icon and the input field) and the title itself, and also more empty vertical space between the title and the image below it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No, this change is not clearly visible. Upon close comparison of the "before" and "after" images, the vertical space between the 'X' icon/input field and the top edge of the dark grey title bar appears to be identical in both images. Similarly, the vertical space between the bottom edge of the dark grey title bar and the image directly below it also appears to be identical in both images. There is no discernible increase in vertical spacing either above or below the main page title.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts regarding the absence of this change. The instruction "Add *more* vertical space" implies an increase, but no such increase is visually present. The spacing around the main page title remains unchanged.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
