Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to soften the background color of list items, making them less opaque, and adding rounded corners.
2. In the "after" image, the background color of the list items appears to be softer and less opaque compared to the "before" image. Additionally, the list items now have rounded corners.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The instructions seem to have been fully implemented.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
