Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction requires two changes: First, the "SIGN UP" and "LOGIN" buttons should be closer to each other. Second, the buttons should be positioned further to the right within the header.
2. Comparing the two images, we can see the "SIGN UP" and "LOGIN" buttons in the after image are closer together compared to the before image. Additionally, the buttons in the after image are placed further to the right side of the header than in the before image.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
