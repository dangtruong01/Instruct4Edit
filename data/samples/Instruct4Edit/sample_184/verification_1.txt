Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to increase the size of the heading "Бюджетные учреждения".
2. Comparing the two images, it is unclear if there is any change to the size of the heading "Бюджетные учреждения". The heading visually appears to be the same size in both images.
3. There is ambiguity as the instruction's effect is not visually evident.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
