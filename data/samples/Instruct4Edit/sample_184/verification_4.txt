Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** Reduce the spacing between the project descriptions. The project descriptions are the blocks of text under the headings like "ФГУ комбинат "Сигнал" Росрезерва".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** It's not possible to definitively say that the spacing between project descriptions has been reduced. There is no clear and visible change in the spacing between the blocks of text.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes.

**Final verdict:** ❌ Not Applied
