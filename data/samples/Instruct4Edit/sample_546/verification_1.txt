Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main navigation menu. This should make it appear as if it's slightly elevated from the page.
2. The main navigation menu is on the left side of the images. By comparing the two images, I cannot see any visual difference in the appearance of the main navigation menu, specifically no shadow has been added.
3. I cannot visually verify that the change was applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
