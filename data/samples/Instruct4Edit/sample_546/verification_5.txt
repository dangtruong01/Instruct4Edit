Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the size of the site logo in the header and footer.
2. I can't see any site logo in the header or footer of both images. Therefore, I cannot confirm if the change was applied or not.
3. The site logo is missing in both images, so the instruction cannot be verified.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
