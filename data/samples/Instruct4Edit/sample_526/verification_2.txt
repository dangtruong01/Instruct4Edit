Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for navigation links to be more evenly spaced and visually distinct. This implies an increase in the space between the links and possibly a change in their appearance (e.g., adding a separator line or a background color).
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, I cannot see any visible difference in the spacing or visual appearance of the navigation links. They appear to be in the same location and have the same style in both images.
3. There is no visible change, so the instruction has not been implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
