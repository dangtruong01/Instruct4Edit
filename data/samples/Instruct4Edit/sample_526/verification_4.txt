❌ Not Applied

Justification:
1. The instruction says to style "上一篇" and "下一篇" links as buttons, implying they should visually resemble buttons (e.g., with a background color, border, etc.).
2. Neither the before nor the after image shows these links styled as buttons. They appear to be plain text links. There is no visual difference between the two images in this respect.
3. I cannot identify any styling change applied to "上一篇" and "下一篇" links to make them look like buttons in the after image compared to the before image.

Final verdict: ❌ Not Applied
