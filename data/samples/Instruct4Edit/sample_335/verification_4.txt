Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to standardize the appearance of the green navigation buttons on the left sidebar. This involves three specific changes:
    *   Ensuring consistent coloring across these buttons.
    *   Applying a more contemporary font style.
    *   Removing the arrows from the buttons that currently have them.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, no visual changes are discernible on the green navigation buttons on the left sidebar.
    *   **Coloring:** The green hue and shading of all buttons ("Leave a Review," "Add Your Business," "View our Feedback," "Business Promotion," "Visit our Business Forum," "Forum Showcase") appear identical in both images. There is no change in consistency or appearance.
    *   **Font Style:** The font used for the text on all these buttons is identical in both images. There is no change to a "more contemporary font style."
    *   **Arrows:** The first four buttons ("Leave a Review," "Add Your Business," "View our Feedback," "Business Promotion") still prominently display the "»" arrow in the "after" image, despite the instruction explicitly stating "without the arrows."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts; the changes instructed have not been applied. All three aspects of the instruction (consistent coloring, contemporary font, and removal of arrows) show no visual difference between the "before" and "after" images. The images of the relevant elements are visually identical.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
