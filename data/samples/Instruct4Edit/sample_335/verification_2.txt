**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to give the main navigation links in the header ("Home", "Add Business", "Business Forum", "Testimonials", "Promotion") a more interactive feel. This is explicitly suggested to involve a visual change such as "changing color or adding an underline when hovered over." This implies a change in their appearance, particularly upon interaction (hover), or a default appearance that signifies interactivity.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon comparing the "before" and "after" images, the main navigation links in the header are visually identical. There is no discernible change in their color, styling, or the presence of an underline in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. Both images display the links in their static, default state. Since the instruction describes a *visual* change (even if triggered by a hover state), and no such change is visible in the provided static "after" image, the instruction does not appear to be implemented *visually*.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The primary ambiguity lies in the instruction mentioning a "hovered over" state, which cannot be directly depicted in a static image unless a specific link was shown *in* its hovered state in the "after" image. However, the instruction broadly states to "Give the main navigation links... a more interactive feel," which often implies a default visual cue that they are interactive, or at least a demonstration of the interactive state. As a "visual UI/UX reviewer," my assessment is strictly based on the visual differences between the two provided static images. Since there are no visual differences for the specified elements, it's impossible to verify that the instruction was applied based on the visual evidence. If a hover state was implemented without any change to the default static appearance, and no hover state is shown, then from a visual review perspective, it remains unconfirmed.
