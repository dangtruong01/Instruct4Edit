Here's my cautious UI/UX review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to transform the current plain text-based business listings into visually distinct, standalone "cards." These cards should appear "elevated" from the background, typically achieved with shadows, and should have increased internal padding or spacing around their content.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Distinct cards:** In the "after" image, each business listing (e.g., "N.E.S Painting and Pressure Cleaning", "Zachary Painting") is now clearly enclosed within a visible rectangular container with rounded corners. This makes them appear much more distinct compared to the "before" image where they were merely blocks of text separated by a thin line.
*   **Elevated cards:** A subtle drop shadow is visible around each of the new card containers in the "after" image. This shadow creates the visual effect of the cards being "elevated" or lifted off the page background.
*   **More internal spacing:** Upon close inspection, there is a clear increase in the padding between the content (business name, address, categories, "Full details" button) and the inner edges of the new card containers. The text no longer feels as "cramped" within the listing area as it did in the "before" image.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, based purely on the visual comparison and the instruction provided, all aspects appear to be clearly and fully implemented. The changes are noticeable and directly address each part of the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
