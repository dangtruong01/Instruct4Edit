Here's my assessment based on the visual comparison:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction intended two main changes to the primary search button:
    *   Significantly increase its size.
    *   Add clear text to it, such as "Search" or "Find".

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Button Size:** In the "before" image, the search button is a small green rectangle to the right of the "near" input field. In the "after" image, this button has been dramatically increased in size, now spanning almost the entire width of the "Search for" and "near" input fields combined, and is also taller. This clearly fulfills "much larger".
*   **Text Addition:** The "before" image shows a blank green button. The "after" image clearly displays the text "Search" centrally placed on the now larger button. This fulfills "add clear text like 'Search' or 'Find'".

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. Both aspects of the instruction – making the button much larger and adding clear text ("Search" was chosen) – are distinctly visible and fully implemented in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
