Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to change the alignment of text paragraphs within the main article content from "evenly stretched across the page" (justified alignment) to "left-aligned."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, this change is clearly visible.
    *   **Before Image:** The main article paragraphs, including the introductory text, the "What are online slots?" description, the descriptions within the numbered list items, and the concluding paragraph, all show text that is justified. Both the left and right edges of the text blocks are straight, giving a "stretched" appearance.
    *   **After Image:** In the modified image, all of these same text paragraphs now exhibit a straight left edge but an uneven, "ragged" right edge. This is the distinct visual characteristic of left-aligned text. The change is consistent across all relevant text blocks in the main content area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements regarding this specific instruction. The change has been implemented fully and clearly across all identified text paragraphs.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
