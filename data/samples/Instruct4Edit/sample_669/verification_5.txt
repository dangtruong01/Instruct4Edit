Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the amount of empty vertical space (whitespace) between different logical content sections located in the right-hand sidebar. Specific examples given are the space between the search functionality and the list of recent posts. This suggests an overall intention to improve readability and visual separation between distinct blocks of content in the sidebar.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible.
    *   **Between the search area and the "Recent Posts" section:** In the "before" image, the "Search" button is relatively close to the "Recent Posts" heading. In the "after" image, a new line of text "Comments are closed." has been added, and the spacing around this text, specifically between it and the "Recent Posts" heading, has increased, thereby adding more vertical separation between the search area and the recent posts list.
    *   **Between the "Recent Posts" section and the "Play and Win the Prize" section:** The most noticeable change is the significant increase in vertical space between the last bullet point of "Recent Posts" and the "Play and Win the Prize" heading and its accompanying image. This gap is considerably larger in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, there are no significant doubts or ambiguities. The instruction's core intent to add more vertical spacing between sections in the sidebar has been visually implemented and is clearly discernible. The inclusion of new text ("Comments are closed.") between two sections contributes to, and is consistent with, the goal of increasing vertical separation.
