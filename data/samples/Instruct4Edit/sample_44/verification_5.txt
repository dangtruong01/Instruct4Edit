Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    *   Reduce the size of the text in the footer.
    *   Center the text in the footer.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   The text size in the footer does appear to be smaller.
    *   The text in the footer appears centered.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    *   The changes are visible.

Final verdict:
