Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to round the corners of the search input field and the search button.
2. The search input field's corners appear to be rounded in the after image. However, the search button isn't visible, so the change cannot be assessed.
3. The change is only partially visible.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
