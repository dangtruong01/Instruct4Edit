Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to darken the background color of the sidebar. I assume the sidebar is the light grey section containing "Recent Posts" and "Recent Comments".
2. By comparing the two images, the light grey background color of the sidebar appears to be slightly darker in the "after" image compared to the "before" image. The difference is subtle but noticeable.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements.

Final verdict:
