Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the main heading font bolder and more prominent. This means the font weight should increase, making the text appear thicker and visually stand out more.
2. Comparing the two images, the "after" image does appear to have a bolder font for the "Omg !!!!" heading. The letters are thicker and have a greater visual presence compared to the "before" image.
3. There are no apparent ambiguities or missing elements. The instruction was straightforward and the change is visible.

Final verdict:
âœ… Fully Applied
