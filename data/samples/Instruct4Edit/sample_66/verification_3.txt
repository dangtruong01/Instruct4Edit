Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a subtle background color to be added to the comment form. This aims to visually separate the form from the surrounding page content.
2. Comparing the two images, the modified image appears to have a very light grey background color applied to the "Submit a Comment" section (the comment form). It is a subtle, but noticeable change.
3. There are no obvious ambiguities or missing elements. The instruction was to add a subtle background, and a subtle background was indeed added.

Final verdict:
