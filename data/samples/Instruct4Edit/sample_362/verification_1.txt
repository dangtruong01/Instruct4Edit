Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to reduce the size of text links in the top bar and distribute them more evenly.
2. Comparing the images, the text links in the top bar ("HOME", "NEWS", "CONTACT US") appear to be very similar in size. The spacing between them is also visually similar.
3. Due to the lack of visual changes, the instructions were not implemented.

Final verdict:
