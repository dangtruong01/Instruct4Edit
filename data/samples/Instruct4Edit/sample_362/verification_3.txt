Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main title "The Carbon Conversation". This should make the text appear to slightly lift off the background, improving its visibility.
2. Comparing the before and after images, I cannot clearly identify a shadow being added to the main title. There is no change in the visual appearance of the title to suggest a shadow effect has been applied.
3. I have some doubt. A subtle shadow should be visible, even if slight.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
