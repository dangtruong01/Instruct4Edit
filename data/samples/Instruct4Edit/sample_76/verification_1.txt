Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to soften the red color of the social media icons in the header and footer to a more inviting shade.
2. The red social media icons in the header and footer in the second image ("after") appear to be the exact same shade of red as the first image ("before"). There is no visible change in color.
3. There are no missing elements, but the color change was not applied.

Final verdict:
