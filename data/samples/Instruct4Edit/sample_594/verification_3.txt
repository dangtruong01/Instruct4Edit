**Step-by-step justification:**
1. The instruction asks to vertically align the content to the middle of the "first set of columns after the heading". Considering the page structure, the first set of columns are most likely referring to the navigation bar at the very top, specifically the links "About", "Contribute", "Subscribe", etc.
2. By comparing the two images, there's no visible change in the vertical alignment of the mentioned links. The links in both images appear to be aligned at the top of their respective containers, which is the default alignment.
3. There are no visible changes that align the text to the vertical center.

**Final verdict:**
