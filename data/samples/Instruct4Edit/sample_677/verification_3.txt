Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between the items in the left-hand navigation list. This means making each link in the list (e.g., "Sun Shade Sails", "Carports", "Boat Canopies") have more vertical separation from the item above and below it, making them feel less dense and potentially increasing their clickable area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, this change is very clearly visible. In the "after" image, the vertical space between each item in the left-hand navigation list has been significantly increased. The list now extends further down the page compared to the "before" image, indicating that more "air" or vertical padding/margin has been added between each link. For example, compare the space between "Sun Shade Sails" and "Carports" in both images – it's noticeably larger in the "after" version.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No, there are no doubts. The instruction was to "add more space inside each item... to make them feel less crowded and easier to click," and the visual evidence clearly shows that the vertical spacing between these items has been increased, achieving precisely that outcome. The list looks less crowded and each item appears to have more distinct space around it.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
