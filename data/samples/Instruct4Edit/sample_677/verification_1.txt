Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to remove an existing image-based navigation section at the top of the page and replace it with a new text-based navigation bar. This new bar should be visually clear and extend across the full width of the page's content area.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Before Image:** In the "before" image, there is a prominent row of nine small, square, image-based elements positioned horizontally just above the "Home > About Our Products > Boat Canopy" breadcrumb. These appear to be navigation links that rely solely on images.
*   **After Image:** This specific row of image-based navigation is entirely absent. In its place, a new, distinct dark blue horizontal bar has been introduced. This bar contains clear, text-based navigation links ("Home", "Products", "Categories", "Contact Us", "About Us", "& Terms & Policies") rendered in white text. This new navigation bar clearly spans the entire width of the page's main content area.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No. The change is precise and unambiguous. The identified image-based navigation has been removed, and a text-based navigation bar, which meets all the specified criteria (clear, text-based, spans width), has been implemented in its place.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
