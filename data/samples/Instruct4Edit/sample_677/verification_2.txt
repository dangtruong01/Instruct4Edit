Here's the comparison and justification:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase the vertical spacing between distinct blocks of text (paragraphs) and between headings/sub-headings and paragraphs within the main content area of the article. This typically improves readability by providing more visual breathing room.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, the change is clearly visible. When comparing the "before" and "after" images, the vertical space between the main heading "Boat Canopy" and the first paragraph, between subsequent paragraphs, and between sub-headings (like "Call Us @ 475-308-8477" and "Start the Process: Get a quote today") and their adjacent paragraphs has consistently increased. The article content in the "after" image appears less dense and more open due to this added spacing.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction "Add more vertical space between all paragraphs and headings within the main article content" appears to have been applied comprehensively and consistently to all instances within the designated content area. No specific sections or elements seem to have been overlooked.

**Final verdict:**
