**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the 'Are You Covered?' phone number section in the header more visually prominent. The suggested methods were to add a background color, use a bolder font, and use a larger font.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The "Are You Covered? Call Us @ 475-308-8477" text is small, black, and sits directly on the white background, making it blend in and not stand out.
    *   **After Image:**
        *   **Background Color:** A distinct light orange/beige background box has been added around the text, immediately separating it from the surrounding white space.
        *   **Bolder Font:** The font used for the text is noticeably bolder, increasing its visual weight.
        *   **Larger Font:** The font size has been increased, making the text easier to read and more dominant within the header area.
    All three aspects of the instruction (background color, bolder font, larger font) are clearly visible and contribute to the section popping out more.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the changes are clear and directly address all parts of the instruction. The section now significantly pops out compared to its original state.

**Final verdict:**
