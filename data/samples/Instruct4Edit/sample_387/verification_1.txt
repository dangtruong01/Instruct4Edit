Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the size and spacing of the email address and social media icons in the top bar.
2. Comparing the two images, the email address in the top bar is visually identical in size and spacing. There are no social media icons present in either of the images.
3. The email address text seems unchanged, and the social media icons are missing entirely from both images, making it impossible to confirm the changes.

Final verdict:
