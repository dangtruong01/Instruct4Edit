Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the article title ("Music Covers: Persona 4 – Never More ENGLISH by Sapphire") and the content (text) below it.
2. By comparing the two images, the spacing between the article title and the content below it appears to be exactly the same.
3. There are no ambiguities, but there is no visual change.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
