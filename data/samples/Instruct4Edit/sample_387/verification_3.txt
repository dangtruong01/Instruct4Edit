Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow behind the main article to visually separate it from the background.
2. Comparing the before and after images, it is difficult to see any shadow effect. It could be very faint, but not confidently visible.
3. The instruction is ambiguous about where exactly "the main article" is and the shadow might be too faint to be noticeable.

Final verdict:
