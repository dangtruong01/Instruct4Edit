Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to center the footer logo and reduce its size. I assume the "footer logo" is the grey square at the bottom of both images.
2. Visually, the logo appears to be centered horizontally in the after image, compared to the before image where it was left-aligned. It is difficult to confirm that its size has been reduced as the logo is low resolution.
3. There might be ambiguity due to the low resolution of the logo in both images.
