Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the spacing between the article title and the article content. This means the space between the title "Birra ed enigmi" and the following text block should increase.
2. Comparing the two images, the spacing between the title and the article content appears to be the same.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change doesn't seem to be applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
