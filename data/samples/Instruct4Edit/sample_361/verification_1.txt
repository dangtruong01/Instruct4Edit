Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a more noticeable border when the search input is selected (focused). "Selected" is interpreted as when the input field is active and ready for input.
2. Neither of the images shows the menu or a search input field, therefore no comparison can be made.
3. The instruction lacks context as the images do not contain a menu or search input.

Final verdict:
