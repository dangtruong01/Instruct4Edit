Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the logo smaller on smaller screens. Since we only have one size image, we can not confirm if this instruction has been implemented.
2. We cannot determine if the logo has been made smaller on smaller screens. The logo is the same size on both images.
3. We need at least 2 images of different screen sizes to confirm this instruction.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
