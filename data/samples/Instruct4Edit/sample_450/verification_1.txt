Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle background color to the main navigation links when hovered over.
2. I cannot see any hover effects. Both images are static and do not represent interactive states. I need to be able to see the hover state to assess if the change was made.
3. Since the image is static, it is impossible to determine if a hover effect was added.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
