Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to lighten the gray background behind the secondary navigation.
2. I can't see any background behind the secondary navigation in both images. Secondary navigation are "ホーム", "運営者情報", "編集について", "お問い合わせ", "サイトマップ". These elements are on a white background in both images.
3. The instruction is not clearly implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
