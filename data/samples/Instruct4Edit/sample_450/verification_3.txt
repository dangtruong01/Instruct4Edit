Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a thin border around the main image.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot see a clear border added around the main image in the 'after' image. The image dimensions appear to be the same, and there is no evidence of a border being added.
3. There are no visible changes, so the instruction was not implemented.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
