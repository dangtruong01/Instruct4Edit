Here's my review based on the provided images and instruction:

**Instruction:** Lighten the color of the copyright text at the very bottom of the page to improve readability.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The intended visual change is to make the color of the copyright text "© Studio Lybertijn | Privacy" at the bottom of the page visibly lighter to contrast better with its dark background, thereby improving its readability.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the copyright text is a very dark grey, almost blending into the black footer background. In the "after" image, the text has been changed to a noticeably lighter shade of grey, which provides better contrast against the black background.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction was specific to "the copyright text at the very bottom of the page" and to "lighten the color to improve readability." The text identified is the copyright text, its color has clearly been lightened, and this change does improve its readability on the dark background. The instruction was fully and clearly implemented.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
