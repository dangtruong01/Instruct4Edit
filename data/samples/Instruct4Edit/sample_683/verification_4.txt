Here's the comparison and verdict:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks to make two specific titles in the sidebar, 'Schrijf je in voor de nieuwsbrief' and 'Agenda', more prominent. This prominence should be achieved by:
*   Increasing their font size.
*   Making them bold.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **'Schrijf je in voor de nieuwsbrief':**
    *   **Boldness:** Yes, the text appears noticeably bolder in the 'after' image compared to the 'before' image.
    *   **Font Size Increase:** This is where it becomes unclear. While the text is bolder, there is no discernible or visually apparent increase in font size. The lines of text for this title seem to occupy the same vertical space and appear the same size as in the 'before' image.
*   **'Agenda':**
    *   **Boldness:** Yes, the text appears noticeably bolder in the 'after' image compared to the 'before' image.
    *   **Font Size Increase:** Similar to the previous title, there is no discernible or visually apparent increase in font size.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
Yes, there is a significant doubt regarding the font size increase. While the 'bold' attribute has clearly been applied, the instruction specifically states to "increase their font size *and* make them bold" to achieve prominence. The font size increase is either absent or so minimal that it is not visually perceptible, failing to meet that part of the instruction clearly. The instruction asks for both actions to make them "more prominent".

**Final verdict:**
