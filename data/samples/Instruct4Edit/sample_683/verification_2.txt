Here's my review based on the provided images:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to add a "subtle hover effect" (like a background color change or underline) to the main menu items to indicate interactivity. This is a dynamic visual change that occurs when a user's mouse cursor hovers over an element.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Both the "before" and "after" images are static screenshots. A hover effect is an interactive state that cannot be observed or confirmed from static images unless one of the images specifically depicts a menu item in its hovered state. In both images, the main menu items ("Lydia Looije", "Familieopstellingen", "Helende reis", "Workshops & Cursus", "Agenda", "Contact") appear identical, with no visible hover state applied to any of them.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** Yes, significant doubt and missing elements. Since I am a visual UI/UX reviewer relying solely on the provided images, and the instruction describes an interactive behavior rather than a static visual change, it is impossible to verify if the hover effect has been implemented. The static nature of the images prevents any confirmation of this dynamic change.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied (Cannot be visually verified from static images)
