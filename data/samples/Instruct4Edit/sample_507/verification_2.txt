Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a subtle shadow to the video in the "Introduction to the Enneagram" section. However, there is no video element in the "Introduction to the Enneagram" section in either of the images.
2. Since there is no video, there is no shadow added.
3. There is no video to apply the shadow effect to. The instruction is unclear in the context of the visual elements present.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
