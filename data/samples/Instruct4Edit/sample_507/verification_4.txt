Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to add a small line between the copyright notice and the "Powered by Kajabi" text in the footer.
2. Visually comparing the two images, there is no visible line added between the copyright information and the "Powered by Kajabi" text in the second image.
3. There is no ambiguity; the requested line is simply not present.

Final verdict:
