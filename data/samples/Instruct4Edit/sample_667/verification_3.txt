Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the horizontal space occupied by the primary content of the article (text and image). This means reducing the left and right margins/padding around this content block, allowing the content elements within it to expand horizontally and take up more of the page's width.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is very clearly visible.
    *   The article title "Sheba" and its accompanying meta-information (e.g., "by admin | May 1, 2023 | Australia | 0 comments") have shifted significantly to the left, indicating that their container or layout area has expanded.
    *   The large placeholder image below the title has visibly widened, now extending much closer to both the left and right edges of the page, compared to its original width.
    *   The main body text of the article ("Sheba medical Center and Sheba Beyond...") has also dramatically increased its horizontal span. This is evident by the text wrapping differently, with significantly more words fitting on each line, and the white space (margins) on its left and right sides being considerably reduced.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities. The widening of the main content area, encompassing both the text and the image, is a substantial and unambiguous change that is clearly demonstrated in the "after" image. Every specified aspect of the instruction appears to have been fully applied.

Final verdict:
