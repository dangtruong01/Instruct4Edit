Here's my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction states that the background color of the dropdown menus in the very top navigation bar should change to match the main dark blue background of that bar. This means the white/light background of the dropdown currently visible should become dark blue.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. In both the "before" and "after" images, the dropdown menu under "SIGN UP FOR UPDATES" (which contains "MAKE A DIFFERENCE.", "DONATIONS", etc.) retains its original white or very light grey background color. It does not match the dark blue background of the main navigation bar in the "after" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts. The visual change specified in the instruction has not been applied at all. The background color of the dropdown remains unchanged.

**Final verdict:**
- ‚ùå Not Applied
