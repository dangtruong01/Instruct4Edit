Here's the step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to transform the existing 'MAKE A DONATION' text block (which includes "MAKE A DIFFERENCE." and the associated tax information) into a clearly defined, visually distinct button. This button should stand out, signal clickability, have a background color that contrasts with its surroundings, and possess slightly rounded corners.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Transformation into a button/block:** In the "before" image, 'MAKE A DONATION' is just plain text aligned with other header links. In the "after" image, this entire text block is encapsulated within a distinct rectangular shape, visually separating it from other header elements and the general background. This enclosure strongly suggests a button or interactive element.
    *   **Prominent:** The new orange background color combined with its defined shape makes it significantly more prominent than it was as plain text. It immediately draws the eye.
    *   **Clearly clickable:** The solid background, defined borders, and contrasting color create a strong visual cue that this element is interactive and clickable, rather than just informational text.
    *   **Contrasting background color:** The 'before' image shows white text on the existing dark blue header background. The 'after' image introduces an orange background for the donation block. Orange provides a strong and clear contrast against the dark blue header, making the element stand out effectively.
    *   **Slightly rounded corners:** The corners of the orange block in the "after" image are visibly rounded, not sharp 90-degree angles. They fit the description of "slightly rounded corners."

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    From a purely visual UI/UX perspective, all aspects of the instruction appear to have been clearly and fully implemented. The element is prominent, looks clickable, has a contrasting background, and its corners are rounded as requested.
