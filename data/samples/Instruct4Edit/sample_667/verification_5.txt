**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requested two specific visual changes:
    *   Increase the font size of the main article title.
    *   Add more vertical space between the main article title and the smaller date/author line below it.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size Increase:** Yes, the text "Visits Sheba" (the new title in the 'after' image) is visibly larger in font size compared to the original "Sheba" title in the 'before' image.
    *   **Vertical Space Increase:** Yes, there is a noticeable increase in the vertical white space between the main article title ("Visits Sheba") and the date/author line ("by admin | May 1, 2023...") in the 'after' image when compared to the 'before' image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The only observation is that the text content of the main article title also changed from "Sheba" to "Visits Sheba" in the 'after' image. However, the instruction *only* specified changes to the *font size* and *vertical spacing* of "the main article title" element, and these visual modifications were indeed applied to the element now functioning as the main article title. Since the prompt specifies to "Only take VISUAL changes into consideration" related to the instruction, the change in text content itself does not prevent the visual instruction from being considered fully implemented on the target element.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
