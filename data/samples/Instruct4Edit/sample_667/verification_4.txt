Here is my review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to add a small horizontal gap between the contact icons (person, phone, email) and their corresponding text descriptions within the dark purple footer section.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible. In the "before" image, the text was directly abutting or very close to the icons. In the "after" image, a distinct, small horizontal space has been introduced between:
    *   The person icon and "Idan Goldberger, Executive Director..."
    *   The phone icon and "0466 246 800"
    *   The email icon and "idan.goldberger@friendsofsheba.org.au"
    This gap is consistent across all three instances.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, the instruction was specific to the icons and their text descriptions in the footer, and the change is consistently applied to all of them. The "small gap" has been successfully added.

**Final verdict:**
âœ… Fully Applied
