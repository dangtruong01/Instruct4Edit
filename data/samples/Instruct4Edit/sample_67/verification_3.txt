Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to ensure that the three dark boxes below "Core Features" have consistent height and that no text overflows. However, in the images provided, I don't see any 'dark boxes'. It looks like the boxes that might be relevant are the three with icons (image management, verbal communication and soft skills).
2. I can't see any changes between the two images, let alone any height adjustment to the boxes with the icons. The text in the boxes doesn't appear to overflow in either image.
3. The ambiguity arises from the fact that there are no 'dark boxes'.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
