Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to highlight the currently active page in the main navigation more clearly. This implies a visual distinction, such as a different color, background, underline, or bolding for the active page's navigation link.
2. Comparing the two images, there is no visual difference in the main navigation. The "Home", "About", "Services", and "Contact" links appear identical in both images.
3. There is no indication of any change to highlight the active page.

Final verdict:
