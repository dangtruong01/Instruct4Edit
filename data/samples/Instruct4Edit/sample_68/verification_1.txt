Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to make the main title ("Driving Schools St Austell Cornwall") larger and bolder.
2. By comparing the two images, the title's size seems similar but not significantly larger. The title also doesn't appear to be visually bolder.
3. The change in size and boldness is not clearly visible or could be misinterpreted as no change at all.

Final verdict:
