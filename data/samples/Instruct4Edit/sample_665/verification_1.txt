Here's the comparison and justification:

**Instruction:** Make the main title text in the page header larger and a different color to stand out more.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the main title text ("小町寿司のパート求人募集情報ならマイナビパート" at the top left) more prominent. This involves increasing its font size and changing its color from the original to a new one, thereby making it stand out more.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before Image:** The main title text is a standard, relatively small size and appears black or dark grey.
    *   **After Image:** The main title text is noticeably larger in size. Its color has also changed from black/dark grey to red. Both changes are clearly visible.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction specifically asked for the text to be "larger" and "a different color," and for it to "stand out more." All these conditions have been met clearly and unequivocally. The size increase is significant, the color change is distinct, and the overall effect is that the title stands out much more than before. There are no doubts or missing elements.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
