**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction was to apply a "soft, light background color" to the "entire search conditions table" to differentiate it from the rest of the page. This means the area containing input fields like "期間・長期", "こだわり条件", "給与", "シフト", "時給帯", and "キーワード" should have a distinct, subtle background tint.
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** No. Upon close inspection and direct comparison of the two images, there is no discernible difference in the background color of the search conditions table area. In both the "before" and "after" images, the background behind the form elements appears to be pure white, indistinguishable from the general page background. The instruction has not been visually implemented.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** There are no doubts regarding the absence of the change. The intended visual differentiation by background color is completely missing in the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
❌ Not Applied
