Here's the detailed review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction targets the "Back to Top" button at the very bottom of the page. The intended changes are:
*   Increase its size (make it visually larger).
*   Center it horizontally on the page.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
*   **Identification of the element:** At the very bottom of the main content area (just before the footer with copyright and small links), there is a text link "パート人材はマイナビパートトップへ" (Part-time human resources Mynavi Part Top). While not explicitly named "Back to Top", its placement at the very bottom and navigational nature strongly suggest this is the intended target.
*   **Size Increase:** In the "before" image, "パート人材はマイナビパートトップへ" is a standard blue text link. In the "after" image, this text is now enclosed within a prominent blue rectangle with white text, giving it the appearance and visual weight of a button. This "button" is significantly larger in both width and height compared to the original text link, clearly fulfilling the "increase the size" instruction.
*   **Centering:** In the "before" image, the text link "パート人材はマイナビパートトップへ" is left-aligned with the main content. In the "after" image, the newly designed button is horizontally centered within the available content width. This clearly fulfills the "center it" instruction.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No significant doubts or ambiguities. The transformation from a subtle text link to a prominent, centered button is clear and fully aligns with both parts of the instruction. Although the text doesn't literally say "Back to Top", it serves a similar function (navigating to a main point from the bottom of the page), making it the most logical element for the instruction.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
