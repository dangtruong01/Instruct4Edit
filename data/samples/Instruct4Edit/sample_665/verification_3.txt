Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction asks to increase the internal padding within all input fields and select boxes located in the "search conditions" area. The expected visual outcome is that these fields and boxes will appear taller due to this added internal space.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Yes, this change is clearly visible.
*   **Input Fields:** Comparing the text input fields (e.g., next to "期間・長期", "キーワード", or the numeric fields under "給与"), it's evident that they are taller in the "after" image. The vertical space between the text cursor/content and the top/bottom borders of the fields has increased.
*   **Select Boxes:** The dropdown select boxes (e.g., under "給与" for area selection, or under "シフト" for date selection) also appear noticeably taller in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.

The change is consistent across all identified input fields and select boxes in the search conditions.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
No, there are no doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was specific about "internal padding" and making the elements "taller," and both aspects are clearly and consistently implemented across all relevant UI components. No input fields or select boxes within the search conditions appear to have been missed.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
