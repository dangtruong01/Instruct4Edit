Here's the review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to make the "No Result" message ("検索条件に該当するパート情報がありません。") and its accompanying text ("検索条件を更新のうえ確認をお願いします。") more prominent. This involves two specific visual changes:
    *   Centering the text horizontally.
    *   Increasing the font size of the text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Centering:** In the "before" image, the two lines of text ("検索条件に該当するパート情報がありません。" and "検索条件を更新のうえ確認をお願いします。") are left-aligned. In the "after" image, both lines are clearly centered horizontally within the main content area. This change is distinctly visible.
    *   **Font Size Increase:** In the "before" image, the font size of both lines appears standard. In the "after" image, the font size of both lines is visibly larger, making them stand out more. This change is also distinctly visible.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both requested changes (centering and increasing font size) have been clearly and fully applied to both lines of the specified text. The implementation appears complete and unambiguous.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
