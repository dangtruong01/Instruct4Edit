Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for a consistent width for the sidebar, implying it might have previously been variable. It also asks for a visual separation between the sidebar and the main content area.
2. Comparing the two images, the sidebar on the left now has a consistent width. It appears to be slightly wider in the "after" image. However, the separation between the sidebar and the main content isn't dramatically different.
3. The visual separation could be improved by adding a vertical line, a different background color for the sidebar, or increasing the margin between the sidebar and the main content.
