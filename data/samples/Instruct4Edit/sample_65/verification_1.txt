Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to give the navigation links (e.g., "<Prev 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next>") at the top and bottom of the main content area a subtle background color on hover. Since the images are static, it is impossible to verify if the hover effect was applied.
2. Based on the current images, it's impossible to confirm if the hover effect on the navigation links has been applied, as hover states cannot be visualized in static images.
3. It's impossible to determine if the changes were applied without being able to interact with the elements or see them in a hover state.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
