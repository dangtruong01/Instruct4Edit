Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for the main heading "Rome to Regain Control of the World" to be made larger and more prominent. This implies an increase in font size and/or a change in font weight to make it stand out more.
2. Comparing the two images, the font size of the main heading appears to be the same. There's no discernible change in font weight either.
3. The instruction has not been applied as there is no visual difference in the main heading between the two images.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
