**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction aims to modify the "site's main title in the header area" by making it significantly larger in font size and increasing its font weight (making it bolder). The identified main title is "ARTICLE n°1".
2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes. In the "before" image, "ARTICLE n°1" is presented in a default font size and weight. In the "after" image, "ARTICLE n°1" is clearly rendered with a substantially larger font size and a noticeably heavier font weight, making it appear much bolder.
3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** No. The visual changes perfectly align with both aspects of the instruction ("much larger" and "bolder") and are unequivocally visible.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
