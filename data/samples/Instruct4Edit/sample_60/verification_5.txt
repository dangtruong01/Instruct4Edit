Here's my review:

**Instruction:** Center the main article heading, "article n°1", on the page.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reposition the text "article n°1" from its initial left-aligned position to a horizontally centered position within the page's content area.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Before image:** The heading "article n°1" is clearly aligned to the left side of the content block.
    *   **After image:** The heading "article n°1" has been moved horizontally and is now visibly centered on the page.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The change is clearly visible and precisely addresses the instruction. The heading is no longer left-aligned and is now situated in the horizontal center of the page.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
