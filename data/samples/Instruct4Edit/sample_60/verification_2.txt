Here's a step-by-step justification of the visual changes:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to remove the `>>` and `<<` symbols from all navigation menu items and content links. The goal is for only the text of these items to remain, implying that the text itself should be unaffected and maintain its original distinctness and relative positioning, simply without the decorative/functional symbols.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Content Links (Bulleted Lists):** Yes, for all the content links in the main body of the document (those preceded by a bullet point), the `>>` and `<<` symbols have been successfully removed. For example, `>> Le Fanzinophile <<` becomes `Le Fanzinophile`. The text content remains, and the overall layout and spacing of these list items appear to be well-preserved, minus the symbols. This part of the instruction is clearly and fully implemented.
    *   **Navigation Menu Items (Top Right):** The `>>` and `<<` symbols have also been removed from `Fanzine Take Care`, `infos`, and `listes des lieux`. However, a crucial layout change has occurred here. In the "before" image, these navigation items were separated by the `<< >>` combination, which visually created distinct separators or gaps between them (e.g., `...Care << >> infos << >> listes...`). In the "after" image, with these symbols removed, the visual separation between `Fanzine Take Care`, `infos`, and `listes des lieux` has completely collapsed. They now appear as a single, concatenated string: `Fanzine Take Care infos listes des lieux`.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a significant doubt regarding the navigation menu items in the top right. While the symbols are indeed removed, the instruction "so only the text remains" implies that the integrity and distinct visual separation of individual text items should be preserved. By removing the symbols *and* the visual spacing they implicitly provided, the design has inadvertently merged these distinct navigation elements into what visually appears to be one continuous text string. This alters the UI/UX of the navigation menu from discrete clickable items to an undifferentiated phrase, which goes beyond simply "removing symbols" and constitutes a structural layout change for those specific elements. It's a partial implementation because the symbols are gone, but the consequence (loss of item distinction) was not handled, leading to a poorer user experience for that specific section.

**Final verdict:**
