Here's my detailed review:

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction specifies two changes for the "article's publication date and author information at the bottom":
    *   **Color:** To be a lighter color.
    *   **Text Size:** To be smaller text.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Identification of elements:** In the "before" image, at the very bottom, we identify "Publié 20 septembre 2023 dans article" (publication date) and "Par ARTIZINES" (author information).
    *   **Color Change:**
        *   **Before:** Both "Publié 20 septembre 2023 dans article" and "Par ARTIZINES" are in a standard black text color, consistent with the main body text.
        *   **After:** In the "after" image, both lines are clearly rendered in a lighter shade of grey, distinct from the black text elsewhere on the page and lighter than their "before" state.
    *   **Text Size Change:**
        *   **Before:** Both lines are at a standard text size.
        *   **After:** In the "after" image, both lines are noticeably smaller in font size compared to their original appearance and also smaller than the surrounding default text size (e.g., "contact" or "Enquêtes").

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements. Both specified elements (publication date and author information) have clearly received both specified visual changes (lighter color and smaller text). The implementation is unambiguous and fully visible.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
