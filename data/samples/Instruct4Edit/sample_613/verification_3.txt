Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to adjust the spacing in the header area to better align the logo and the telephone information vertically. However, there is no telephone information or related contact information within the header in either image. The contact information provided is in the footer, and is not associated with the logo.
2. Because there is no telephone information within the header, the instruction cannot be applied.
3. It is unclear which "telephone information" is referred to.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
