Step-by-step justification:
1. The intended visual change is to round the corners of all buttons.
2. The "CLOSE" button in the top left corner seems unchanged. The buttons in the left panel (e.g. "閉じる", "文字講座", etc.) are still not rounded.
3. There are doubts and ambiguities because no button has rounded corners.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
