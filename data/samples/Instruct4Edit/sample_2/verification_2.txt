Here's my analysis:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?** The instruction is to darken the blue background of the header section.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?** Yes, the header's blue background in the "after" image is a slightly darker shade than the blue in the "before" image.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?** The change is subtle, but definitely noticeable.

**Final verdict: âœ… Fully Applied**
