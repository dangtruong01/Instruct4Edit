Here's the breakdown:

1.  **Intended Visual Change:** The instruction requests the sidebar to be reduced in size (narrower) or hidden on smaller screens.

2.  **Change Visibility:** I do not see any change in the size or presence of the sidebar between the two images. The sidebar appears identical in both the "before" and "after" images.

3.  **Doubts/Ambiguities:** The instruction is about a change based on screen size. There is no indication that smaller screens are present, so the instruction can't be validated.

**Final Verdict: ‚ùå Not Applied**
