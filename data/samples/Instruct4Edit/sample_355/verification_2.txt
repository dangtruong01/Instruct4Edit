Step-by-step justification:
1. The intention is to make the pagination links (1, 2, 3, >, ») more visible by increasing their font size and darkening their color.
2. Comparing the "after" image to the "before" image, I can't see any significant changes to the font size or color of the pagination links. The color looks nearly identical, and the font size seems the same as well.
3. There are no missing elements as such, but the instruction hasn't been visually applied.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
