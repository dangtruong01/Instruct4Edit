Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to add a subtle shadow to the main table headers.
2. By comparing the 'before' and 'after' images, there is no visible shadow on the table headers in either image.
3. It looks like the instruction may have not been implemented.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
