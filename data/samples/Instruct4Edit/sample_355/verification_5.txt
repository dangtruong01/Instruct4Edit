Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asked for the buttons to be made more modern, flat design with rounded corners.
2. Comparing the before and after images, there are no visual changes. All buttons appear to have the same styling in both images.
3. Since the button style hasn't changed, the instruction has not been applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
