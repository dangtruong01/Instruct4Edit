Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the padding around the logo in the header to make it less tight against the header's edges.
2. Comparing the "before" and "after" images, it's difficult to see if the padding around the logo was modified, since I don't have access to it. There is a person icon in the right side, and it seems that its position remains the same in the after image.
3. I'm unable to determine if the instruction was fully or partially applied, or not applied at all.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
