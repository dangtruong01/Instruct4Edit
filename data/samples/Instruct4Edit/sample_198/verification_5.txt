Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks for two changes in the footer, specifically related to the social media icons: making them bigger and adding a hover effect.
2. Visually, the social media icons in the "after" image appear to be the same size as the "before" image. Also, I can't observe any hover effect as the image is static.
3. The icon sizes seem unchanged, and there's no visual indication of a hover effect.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
