Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to increase the font size and darken the color of the main navigation menu at the top of the page.
2. Comparing the two images, I cannot discern any difference in the font size or color of the menu items at the top. The navigation menu appears identical in both images.
3. There is no visible change in the second image, so the instruction was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
