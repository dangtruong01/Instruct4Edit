Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to reduce the height of the logo in the top left corner, especially on smaller screens. Since we don't know the screen size, we should look for any reduction in the logo's height.
2. Comparing the two images, the logo's height in the top left corner appears to be the same.
3. There is no visible change in the logo's height.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
