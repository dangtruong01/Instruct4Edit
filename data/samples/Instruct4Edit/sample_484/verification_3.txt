Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction asks to round the corners of the input fields in the comment form to soften their appearance.
2. Comparing the before and after images, there is no visual difference in the roundness of the input field corners. They appear to have the same sharp corners in both images.
3. There are no ambiguities in the instruction, but the change is not visible.

Final verdict:
