**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks to locate social media icons in the footer, make them slightly larger, and add a distinct circle or square background to each.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Upon careful comparison of both the "before" and "after" images, no social media icons are visible anywhere in the footer or any other section of the page. The content of both images is identical, showing no changes whatsoever.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there is a fundamental missing element: the social media icons themselves. Since the icons are not present in either the original or the modified image, the instruction to enhance them cannot have been applied. Both images are visually identical, indicating no changes were made.

**Final verdict:**
