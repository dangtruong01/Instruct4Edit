Step-by-step justification:
1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction is to increase the vertical spacing (margins or padding) above and below the main content sections. Specifically, examples given are "around the video and the introductory text." This implies more visual separation for these key elements from their surrounding content.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Space below the text section before the video:** In the "after" image, the vertical space between the text paragraph ending "Warum sammelt man Altpapier?" and the video embed has clearly increased compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Space below the video:** In the "after" image, the vertical space between the video embed and the text "Das am Ende des Videos verlinkte Video:" has clearly increased compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Space around the introductory text:** The vertical space above the introductory text (starting "Das Team von TheSimpleChemics...") and below it (before "In diesem Video wird erklärt...") appears to be identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no visible increase in spacing for this section.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are missing elements. While the spacing "around the video" has been partially addressed (increased space below the preceding text and below the video itself), the instruction specifically called out "around the *introductory text*" as well. This part of the instruction has not been implemented, as there is no discernible change in the vertical spacing above or below the introductory text block. The instruction also said "above *and* below" generally, and the spacing *above* the introductory text, for instance, remains unchanged.

Final verdict:
❌ Not Applied
