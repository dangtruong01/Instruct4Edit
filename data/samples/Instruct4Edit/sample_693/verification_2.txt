Here's my analysis as a highly cautious UI/UX reviewer:

**Instruction:** Ensure the main heading "Papier Herstellung" appears more prominent, perhaps by increasing its size and making it bold.

---

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The primary goal is for the main heading "Papier Herstellung" to appear more prominent. The instruction suggests two specific ways to achieve this: "increasing its size" and "making it bold." The word "perhaps" indicates these are suggestions, but they are linked by "and," implying both were considered means to achieve the desired prominence.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Prominence:** Yes, the heading "Papier Herstellung" *does* appear more prominent in the after image.
    *   **Making it bold:** Yes, the text "Papier Herstellung" is clearly bold in the after image, whereas it was not bold in the before image. This contributes to its increased prominence.
    *   **Increasing its size:** No, the font size of "Papier Herstellung" appears to be exactly the same in both the before and after images. It has not been increased.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    Yes, there are missing elements. While the heading is now more prominent due to being bold, the instruction explicitly suggested "increasing its size **and** making it bold." Since the size was *not* increased, one of the two specific suggestions connected by "and" was not implemented. As a cautious reviewer, even with "perhaps," if specific methods are outlined with "and," a full implementation would address both or provide reasoning for omitting one. In this case, the suggested size increase was omitted.
