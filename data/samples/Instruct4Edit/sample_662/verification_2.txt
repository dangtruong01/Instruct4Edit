As a highly cautious visual UI/UX reviewer, I have carefully compared the two images.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction was to add a subtle visual depth, such as a soft shadow or a border, to the main information panel that lists the IP details. This panel is identified as the section containing "IP address: 202.6.238.0", "IP long: 3389451776", "Hostname: 202.6.238.0", "ASN: AS23756 PADINET - Padi Internet", and "Country: Indonesia".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    No. Upon meticulous comparison of the "before" and "after" images, there is no discernible visual difference whatsoever around the specified "main information panel that lists the IP details." Neither a shadow nor a border has been added, nor any other element that would suggest visual depth. The "after" image appears to be pixel-for-pixel identical to the "before" image in the relevant area.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    There are no doubts or ambiguities regarding the intended change not being applied. The requested visual modification (adding depth via shadow or border) is entirely missing from the "after" image.

**Final verdict:**
‚ùå Not Applied
