Here's a step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to increase the vertical whitespace (spacing) between three specific content elements:
    *   The article's main heading ("Discover RTGS kiya hai...")
    *   Its featured image (the large empty white rectangle)
    *   The introductory paragraph (the first block of Hindi text below the image)
    The goal is to provide "more visual breathing room."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes, the change is clearly visible:
    *   **Between the main heading and the featured image:** In the "before" image, the space between the main heading and the date/admin line (`August 23, 2023 | December 16, 2019 by Admin`) is somewhat tight. The space between this date/admin line and the top of the featured image also appears limited. In the "after" image, there is a noticeable increase in vertical space both above and below the date/admin line, effectively pushing the featured image further down from the main heading.
    *   **Between the featured image and the introductory paragraph:** This is the most pronounced change. In the "before" image, the introductory paragraph starts almost immediately below the featured image, with minimal vertical separation. In the "after" image, a significant amount of vertical whitespace has been added between the bottom of the featured image and the top of the introductory paragraph, creating much more breathing room.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No doubts or ambiguities. The instruction was to increase spacing between the "main heading, its featured image, and the introductory paragraph." All these specific points of separation have been addressed with increased vertical spacing, successfully giving the content more visual breathing room.
