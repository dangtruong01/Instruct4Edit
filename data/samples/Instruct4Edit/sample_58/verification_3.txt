Here's my review based on the visual comparison:

**Target Element:** The "Search" button located next to the search input field, above the "Recent Posts" section in the sidebar.

**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requested two specific visual changes for the search button:
    *   Add a subtle background color.
    *   Slightly soften its corners.
    The overall goal is to make the button "more noticeable."

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Background Color:** In the "before" image, the search button has a white/transparent background. In the "after" image, the search button clearly displays a light gray background color. This color is indeed subtle and effectively makes the button stand out more against the page background.
    *   **Softened Corners:** In the "before" image, the corners of the search button are sharp and square. In the "after" image, the corners are visibly rounded, appearing softer than before. The degree of rounding is slight, matching the "slightly softening" instruction.
    *   **More Noticeable:** Both changes together (the added background and the softened corners) contribute to the button being more distinct and noticeable.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both parts of the instruction ("subtle background color" and "slightly softening its corners") have been clearly and completely implemented. The changes are evident and align perfectly with the given instructions.

**Final verdict:**
