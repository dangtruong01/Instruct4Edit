Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction asks for two specific changes to the main article title:
    *   Increase its font size.
    *   Center it horizontally on the page.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Font Size:** Yes, the text "Bounce Time – Together With The Hearts Of Your Football Fans Often" is visibly larger in the "after" image compared to the "before" image.
    *   **Horizontal Centering:** Yes, in the "before" image, the title is left-aligned. In the "after" image, the title is horizontally centered within its content column, with each line of the title centered relative to the overall title block.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No, both parts of the instruction (increasing font size and horizontal centering) are clearly and fully implemented in the "after" image.

Final verdict:
✅ Fully Applied
