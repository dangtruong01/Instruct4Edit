**Step-by-step justification:**

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction requests that the specific text "copyright and theme information" located in the very bottom section of the page footer be horizontally centered. This refers to the line "© 2023 Jazz Atthe Geor GianTheme by Puro".

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    Yes. In the "before" image, the text "© 2023 Jazz Atthe Geor GianTheme by Puro" is clearly left-aligned within the footer area. In the "after" image, this exact line of text is now visibly positioned in the horizontal center of the footer section. The other two lines of text ("5 Great Times To Become To A Spa With Massages" and "No Deposit Casino Bonus – The Myth And Realities") were not part of the instruction and remain in their original positions, which is correct as per the specific instruction.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    No. The instruction was clear and specific to the "copyright and theme information text" at the "very bottom section of the page footer". This specific element was precisely targeted and its alignment was changed from left to center, without affecting other elements or introducing new issues.

**Final verdict:**
✅ Fully Applied
