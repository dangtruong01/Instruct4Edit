Here's my review:

**1. What is the intended visual change?**
The instruction aims to increase the amount of vertical white space separating individual paragraphs within the main article content. This would make paragraphs appear more distinct and potentially improve readability by reducing text density.

**2. Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
Upon careful comparison of the main article content area in both images, there is no visible change in the vertical spacing between paragraphs. The distance between the bottom of one paragraph and the top of the next paragraph appears identical in both the "before" and "after" images. The line height within paragraphs also remains the same.

**3. Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
There are no doubts; the instruction was not implemented visually. The spacing between paragraphs is precisely the same in both versions.

**Final verdict:**
