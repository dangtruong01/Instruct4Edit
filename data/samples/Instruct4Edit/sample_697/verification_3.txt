Step-by-step justification:

1.  **What is the intended visual change?**
    The instruction aims to reduce the visual prominence of the text links located in the right-hand sidebar. Two methods were suggested: lightening their color or reducing their font size.

2.  **Is this change clearly visible in the after image compared to the before image?**
    *   **Color Change:** In the "before" image, the text links in the right-hand sidebar are a vibrant light blue/cyan. In the "after" image, these links have been changed to a lighter, less saturated grey/white color. This change in color significantly reduces their visual prominence compared to the previous bright blue.
    *   **Font Size Change:** Upon careful comparison, the font size of the text links in the right-hand sidebar appears to be identical in both the "before" and "after" images. There is no visible reduction in font size.

3.  **Are there any doubts, ambiguities, or missing elements?**
    The instruction provided two alternative methods ("perhaps by lightening their color *or* reducing their font size"). While only the color lightening was applied and not the font size reduction, the core objective of making the links "less prominent" has been clearly achieved through the color change. The change from a bright blue to a muted grey/white significantly reduces their visual impact and draws less attention.

Final verdict:
