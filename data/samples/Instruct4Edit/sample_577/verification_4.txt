Step-by-step justification:
1. The instruction is to center the author name and update date directly under the main image.
2. Comparing the two images, the author name ("Georges Alexandre") and the update date ("Updated on: 16 Oct 2023, 07:09 AM") are not visible in the "after" image.
3. The author and the update date are not visible in the after picture, which means that the centering was not applied.

Final verdict:
‚ùå Not Applied
